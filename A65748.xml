            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>But chiefly the <hi>Three firſt Chapters of the Book</hi> called <hi>Geneſis</hi> deſerve to be conſidered by us, as delivering that fundamental doctrine concerning the <hi>Creation of the World, the Fall of Man,</hi> and the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Seed who ſhould be our Reſtorer,</hi> upon which all the reſt of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is built.</p>
            <p>In Opening theſe Chapters many have laboured Worthily, and
<pb facs="tcp:40146:5"/>among the reſt this <hi>Our Authour</hi> hath his <hi>Peculiar Excellency;</hi> for whiles ſome deſerve eſteem for clearing the <hi>letter</hi> and <hi>phraſe,</hi> for <hi>vindicating the doctrine</hi> therein contained in a <hi>Controverſal Way;</hi> Others by other wayes of Illuſtration and giving Light to the Text; That praiſe which was reſerved for our Authour, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a ſolid Expoſition of the Text, The deducing of <hi>Apt and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Obſervations,</hi> together with <hi>fit and proper Reaſons</hi> to each Point, which with what <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Acuteneſſe</hi> it is performed, I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak of the Worth of the Authour is needleſſe, his <hi>praiſe being already in all the Churches:</hi> onely I muſt profeſſe my ſorrow, that, he being a Perſon of ſo much Eminency and Note, none hath as yet Collected the Memorable paſſages of his Life: If his

For ſurely the <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Various Experiences</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Captain</hi> in the Lords Hoaſts, ſuch a <hi>Veterane</hi> in Chriſts Service, muſt needs yield much matter of <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> when we ſhall come to the notice of them.</p>

From the Author that penned it, it is called <hi>Moſes</hi> his Book; as our Saviour in like manner calls <hi>Exodus</hi> his book, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.26.

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Writings.</head>
                  <p>IT cannot be denyed, that the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> have the ſame Authority with the reſt of the holy Scriptures, being delivered, as the reſt of them were, by the ſame Divine inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. And yet withall, theſe Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> may, in ſome reſpects, be conceived to gain ſome kind of praeeminence above the reſt of the Scriptures, ſeeing that they are not only the firſt in order, but in ſome ſort the Fountain, containing the ſumme of thoſe holy Writings that follow. For the hiſtories of the Old Teſtament are, for the moſt part, but as ſo many inſtances of the fulfilling of the ſeveral Sanctions of the Law, delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as well in Judgment, as in Mercy: And the Writings of the Prophets are but applications of the Law, and the Sanctions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to particular places, times, and perſons, interlaced with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Promiſes, the Heads whereof we find in theſe five Books. And the Books of the New Teſtament contain, for the greateſt part, the relation of thoſe promiſes of Grace, firſt recorded and ſet out by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after repeated, and enlarged by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (to which uſe our Saviour applyeth them both, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27, 44.), together with a clear, and full unfolding of that ſtate of Grace, into, which we are reſtored by Chriſt, ſhadowed out, in a great part, by Types, in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hence it is, that in many of the Writings of the Prophets, and much more in thoſe of the Evangeliſts, we have the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo often cited, and thereby the Authority of them the more fully eſtabliſhed, and confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the Means, by which <hi>Moſes</hi> might get the knowledge of the things which he relates in this Firſt book of his, whereof all were acted before his time, and ſome (as namely the Creation of the World) before all mens times, if we ſuppoſe he had no help of any Records, to inform him (which the Church might then have, though they be now loſt); or if we make no great account of the Tradition of the Fathers, whoſe memories were the Regiſters of the Church, before the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Notwithſtanding, it ſufficeth; that the ſame Spirit that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his hand in writing, withall informed him fully, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40146:6"/>of thoſe Truths which he was to leave upon record to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And yet we muſt take notice, that all that is contained in the four Books following (except the hiſtories of his own Life, and Death) were confirmed unto him, by his own knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; his own eyes, and eares being witneſſes of all that he writes. A circumſtance from which ſome of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, juſtly challenge credit unto that which they deliver, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>IN the beginning]</hi> Of time, as ſome ſupply it; or (as others) of the Creation. Or, to ſpeak more clearly, Of the Creatures: To make this the ſenſe: The firſt beginning which the Creatures had, when there was yet none of them, they received in this manner, which is afterwards expreſſed. A like phraſe of ſpeech, or rather to the ſame ſenſe, we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.16. where the Pſalmiſt tells us, that his members were faſhioned, by God, in continuance, when there was yet none of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God]</hi> The word, <hi>Elohim,</hi> which we render God, ſignifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Almighties, or Mighty Powers, and ſeemes, in this place, to point at that wonderful Power, which God manifeſted in this glorious work, when he created the whole world out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the very conſideration whereof is ſufficient to aſtoniſh any one that thinks of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Created]</hi> That is, made of nothing, or without any matter at all; An act peculiar to God alone, wherein he gave all things that now are, or have been in the world, ſince the beginning thereof, a Being, when they were not at all; Now becauſe the word <hi>Bara,</hi> which we render <hi>Created,</hi> is in the Originall tongue put in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and joyned with <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is of the Plural Number, ſome have drawn thence an argument, to prove the Trinity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Godhead, as implyed in the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> being of the Plurall Number; and the Unity of the Godhead, as intimated in the word <hi>Bara,</hi> which is of the Singular Number. But that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall truth, is more fully ſtrengthened by many more clear and evident arguments, out of other places of Scripture; Although we deny not but that this alſo may be a probable collection, out of thoſe words, ſeeing we know the Holy Ghoſt cannot be conceived to take up any unuſuall phraſe, or form of ſpeech, but upon reaſon, and with a mind to conveigh thereby ſomething unto us for our obſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heaven and Earth]</hi> Or (as the Apoſtle calls it) the world, and all things therein, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 24. So then this verſe is the ſumme of this Chapter following, ſetting before us in one word, what was done: the manner How, and order Wherein, is particularly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40146:7"/>in the verſes following. There are notwithſtanding ſome, who by Heaven, in this place, underſtand that glorious body, which the Apoſtle calls the third Heaven, 2, <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. the ſeat of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and under the ſame name, include the Angels, which have their dwelling there, and came to have been made before the Creatures here below, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. whoſe creation they conceive, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not omit: and therefore having not mentioned it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they conjecture it muſt be pointed at in this word. But that Argument appears to be grounded upon a ſuppoſition that wants evidence, namely that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended, in this hiſtory, to give us the deſcription of all Gods creatures Viſible, and Inviſible, where as it ſeems much more probable, that he contains himſelf, to diſcover unto us, onely the Creation of the viſible world. So that we may probably conceive, that in this place he intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Indefinitely to ſignifie, that it was God alone that gave a Being to all things that are, which they had not before, without pointing at any particular; As for the Angels, this generall intimation muſt neceſſarily imply, that they alſo were Gods Creatures, although their creation be not deſcribed, or pointed at in particular, as not ſo needſul to be known by us, whom it concerns moſt, to underſtand the ſtate and condition of thoſe viſible things, with which we have moſt to do.</p>
                  <p>The firſt circumſtance which here offers it ſelf to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſervation is the phraſe and manner of ſpeech which the Holy Ghoſt makes choice of, in this narration, which we ſee, is as Plain as it is Brief without any manner of inſinuation, by way of preface, and without any garniſhing by art, or eloquence which men uſually make uſe of, for the ſetting out, and gracing of their writings: the Spirit of God ſuddenly, as it were, darting out the truth which he delivers like the Sun beams breaking in an inſtant as out of a cloud, as being a light viſible, and beautifull in it ſelf, and therefore needing no other ornament, or varniſhing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the world: Whence we may</p>

                     <head>1. <hi>Obſerve, Divine Truths ſufficiently commend themſelves, without the help of any Ornaments, of Art, or Eloquence.</hi>

A truth which is moſt clearly manifeſted by this, that thoſe divine truths ſhall never appear ſo glorious, as when they ſhall be fully revealed in heaven, as it were by the view of them, when Art and humane Eloquence ſhall be no more.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40146:8"/>
                     <p> Let us then deſire, both to hear, and preach the Truth of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets it out to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in plain and clear expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, demonſtrated, and diſplaied by the Spirit, rather than gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the entiſing ſpeeches of humane Eloquence, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3.4. The great art in Preaching, is to make things clear, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by expreſſing them ſpiritually, as they are ſpirituall in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which needs more help of Logick, than of Rhetorick, but more Experience than them both. Notwithſtanding, the uſe of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not to be denied, even in the work of the Miniſtry, ſo it be neither affected, nor depended on, either by the Preacher, or by the Hearer.</p>
                     <p>The next obſervable circumſtance, in this brief Compendium, of the hiſtory of the Creation of the vvorld, the ſumme vvhereof is compriſed in this firſt verſe, is, the order here obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt; who firſt laies down unto us this ground of Truth, that God made the vvorld, and aftervvards expreſſeth hovv, and in vvhat order he created it, in every particular; by this order vvhich he obſerves in this narration, pointing out unto us in a ſort, the right order in believing Gods Truth; ſo that vve may thence</p>

                     <p>Let it then be our labour to bring our hearts to a full aſſent unto Gods Truths upon his own Teſtimony, though we cannot ſound the depth of them, nor underſtand How, When, in what Manner, or by what Means they are, or ſhall be accompliſhed.

But it ſeems more probable, that <hi>Rakiah,</hi> implyes only the Extention, or ſpreading out, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2.) not the compacted firmneſſe of the Heavens, ſeeing that under this name <hi>Firmament,</hi> we muſt neceſſarily compriſe, as well the aire which is ſpread out, over, and round about the earth, as that firmer body of the Heaven above; of which, more anon. That the heaven above is underſtood by the name of <hi>Firmament,</hi> it is evident, becauſe God ſet the Moon and the Sun and Starres in the <hi>Firmament,</hi> verſ. 14. And, that it includes the Aire alſo, is as Evident, ſeeing God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the birds to flye in the open <hi>Firmament,</hi> ver. 20. Now if we conceive the Planets and Stars to move in the Ayr, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with very great ſhew of reaſon maintain, the opinion may ſeem to be favoured by the Holy Ghoſt in this Chapter, who calling both the Ayr where the birds flye, and the Heaven in which the Starres are carried, by one name, may ſeem to imply, that they are both carried in the ſame body of the Ayr, though at a great diſtance one from the other. Howſoever it is moſt probable, that the word <hi>Firmament,</hi> in this place, includes at the uttermoſt no more, then the ſphear in which the Stars are carried, which is the uttermoſt bound of the viſible world, the making whereof was that which <hi>Moſes</hi> only intended to deſcribe in this place, where we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all mentioned concerning the Third Heavens, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who have their reſidence therein.</p>

Now what theſe Waters be, that are below the Firmament, we ſee; but what is meant by the Waters that are above the Firmament, is much queſtioned. Some place them above the Starres, and imagine them to be either a kind of Chriſtal ſphaere, which is termed <hi>Waters,</hi> for the reſemblance which it hath unto waters congealed; or elſe that there are true real waters there indeed. Others by the <hi>Waters above,</hi> underſtand the waters which are carried in the Ayr, above the Earth, in the Clouds, and bound up in them, <hi>Job</hi> 26.8.

It makes way both to the motion of our ſelves, and every other moving Creature, by the yielding nature thereof; without which the places in which we, and other creatures are, would become our priſons: and conſequently would make both them and us utterly unfit for any ſervice at all. 4.

                     <p>The dividing of the waters from the waters (which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be one uſe of the Ayre) is a work worth the ſcanning, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if by the waters above we underſtand the clouds, vvhich contain the rain which is raiſed in thin vapours, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſevered thereby from the waters below: and carried about over our heads, and let down upon the Earth, without which a great part of it would be utterly unfruitfull; for God having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the water here below into one Chanel, that the Earth might be dry, and by that means habitable, howſoever in his Wiſdom and Providence he hath ſo ordered it, that waters iſſuing out from the Seas by ſecret paſſages, and breaking out into Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Rivers, may thereby make fruitfull the vallies and lower parts of the Earth: yet we know they reach not to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grounds, much leſſe to the tops of the hills. It was therefore needful that ſome water ſhould be carried on high above the hills, and higher grounds; that from thence they might diſtil, and fall down in juſt ſhowers upon the mountaines and higher places of the Earth, to moiſten them too, that no part thereof might remain barrain and unprofitable: and might thereby further manifeſt the care and Providence of God, in cheriſhing thoſe parts from Heaven, which ſeem to be moſt unprovided, and in a ſort neglected,

Some there are that imagine, the work of gathering the water into their channels, and diſcovering the dry land thereby, to be a part of the work of the Second day: As well, becauſe they conceive it likely, that when God began to diſpoſe of the waters, he made an end of that whole work at once, and did it not by halves, part on one day, and part on next: As alſo becauſe that, unleſſe theſe two verſes be taken into the hiſtory of the ſecond daies work; the work of that day wants Gods Approbation, which we find annexed, to the works of all the other daies, both before and after, And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if we make theſe two verſes part of the deſcription of the third daies work, we have a double approbation of the work of that day, which we find in none of the reſt: although there ſeeme to be as great, or a greater occaſion, of doubling that approbation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſixth daies work, than there is here. But whether upon theſe conjectures it be fit to allow an inverſion of the order of the Text; (although upon manifeſt, and undeniable reaſons, we are inforced to do it in ſome other places) let the Reader judge: Few Interpreters follow this opinion.</p>

How they were gathered into one place it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to diſpute. He that was able to make them, by his Word, could more eaſily gather them together, by the ſame word.

Although (if we ſet aſide the rivers, and lakes, which are ſcarce worth the naming, in compariſon of the Ocean) the Sea may juſtly be accounted but one great body, branched out into divers limbs: ſo the place or Channel thereof, may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be One, although the bounds thereof be extended as far as the world is wide in compaſſe.</p>

The ſeed falls into the ground, and ſhoots up into a tender graſſe; that growes into a ſtronger ſtemme, and ſends forth in ſome a flower, in others another form; under the flower comes and ripens the ſeed again, the ſame in form and nature with that from which it ſprung at firſt. That this diſtinction between the ſeveral kinds of creatures, all produced by the ſame common cauſes, and the Identity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40146:30"/>kind, and agreableneſſe thereto of every individual in that kind, through ſo many variations into ſeverall ſhapes and forms, till it come to perfection, ſhould be conſtantly and unchangeably preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, can come to paſſe by no other means; but by the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble law which God hath ſet in nature, by which he gives to every ſeed his own body as it pleaſeth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.38. And to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plant and herb his own ſeed, ſo that men gather not grapes of thorns, nor figgs of thiſtles, as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.44.</p>
                  <p>In the order of this decree, for the production of herbs, and plants, it is obſervable, that all theſe are Created before the Sunne, or any other of thoſe Celeſtiall bodies, by the influence whereof they are now cheriſhed; without which either they ſpring not at all, or at leaſt come to no perfection, that we may know them to be the effects of Gods Power, and not of any natural cauſe: and were produced before the beaſts, or Man, that were to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, to manifeſt Gods Providence; who failes not to make proviſion for all his Creatures, which he foreſees, and takes care to ſupply even before they need; nay before they have any being at all.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ground, that herbs, and plants, were produced in their full ripeneſſe, ſome conclude that the world was created in the Autumne, when all things in the courſe of nature, come to their full growth and ripeneſſe. An argument that might be eaſily anſwered, ſince God muſt be acknowledged, in their firſt Creation, to do all things Miraculouſly: and therefore did not bind himſelf to obſerve the courſe of nature at all, in that work (as appears in the Creation of the man and woman, not Infants, but of full growth; in the firſt moment of their Creation) and to regard as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the time of ripening herbs, and plants, as he did the cauſes that ſhould produce them.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Greater Light]</hi> He meanes the Sunne, exceeding the whole Earth in bigneſſe more then 162. times; or, as ſome ſay, 166. times if we may believe Aſtronomers. Now the Sunne is called the greater Light, not only in reſpect of the huge bulke of the body of it; but becauſe the Light being planted in it, it ſhines more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and heats more fervently then the Moon and all the Stars, which borrow all or the moſt part of their Light from the Sun; And ſo, as they muſt needs have it more imperfectly; ſo they muſt ſhew it forth leſſe clearly and gloriouſly-</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To rule the day]</hi> Not onely to appear gloriouſly, as Rulers and Princes do in their Dominions when they appear in ſtate, but beſides by directing men in their affaires by the Light which it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40146:39"/>gives, which ſhewes them what to do; for when the night and darkneſſe comes, no man can work. Now direction is a Branch of Rule and Government; withall the Light and influence of the Sunne have a ſpecial operation on the Creatures here below, by which the affaires of men are much furthered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the leſſer Light to rule the Night]</hi> It is true, the Moon hath her Operation in the day time alſo, as appears moſt clearly in the Ebbs and floods of the Sea, which are queſtionleſſe governed eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Moon; But becauſe in the day time her Light is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the Sunne, and her beauty and ſplendor appears, only in the Night, the Moon is not improperly ſaid to have the rule and guidance of the Night. For which cauſe God in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hath ſo ordered the Courſe of thoſe two Planets, that the Moon is moſt ſerviceable unto us when we have leaſt help from the Sunne, ſo that ſhe ſhines brighteſt and longeſt, when the nights are longeſt and darkeſt: for in the winter ſeaſon the Moon at the full is in her higheſt exaltation, and is at the Summer time in her loweſt declination, when there is leaſt need of her light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſtars alſo]</hi> Which the Holy Ghoſt paſſeth over in a word, as being leſſe obſervable by our eye then either Sunne or Moon, although in themſelves the leaſt of them be a moſt glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of incredible greatneſs, the leaſt fixed ſtar being many times bigger then the whole Earth, if we may believe Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the ornaments of Gods glorious Throne, which raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophet <hi>David</hi> with aſtoniſhment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3. To which if we compare, thoſe beggarly ſhewes of blazing lights of Torches and Tapers, wherewith the Princes of this world, ſet out their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces by night and grace their Perſons, when they deſire to appear glorious to men, we ſhall find juſt cauſe to ſmile in our thoughts at the baſeneſſe &amp; beggery of humane glory, &amp; to cry out with the Prophet, Ceaſe from the man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils for wherein are they to be eſteemed? And turning away our eyes from thoſe which dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, and who wanting Majeſty in themſelves ſtrive to appear glorious in the Ornaments of other Creatures baſer then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to amaze our ſelves with the Majeſty of him whoſe Throne is in the Infinite Circuit of heaven, adorned with ſo many glorious Lights of ſuch incredible greatneſſe, of ſuch glory in brightneſſe, &amp; excellency in their uſes: All which the Creator of them ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in glory, dwelling in the light that no man can attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; that we may juſtly take up the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> exclamation, <hi>O Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth, who haſt ſet thy Glory above the heaven!</hi> Pſal. 8.1.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Lights are great in their appearance unto us, greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in their true meaſure, although nothing in compariſon of him that made them, for the manifeſtation of his own greatneſs

But in this place it ſeems to be ſet in oppoſition againſt the beaſts of the field, and therefore is conceived to ſignifies tame Beaſts, which men keep about them in their Grounds or Houſes, for Food, Labour, or Pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>Why God made not the Beaſts with the Birds and Fiſhes on the fifth day, but made them on the ſixth day, together with man, it is Curioſity to enquire, God had power to make What, and When, he would; and is not to be accountable to us for any of his actions, or for any Circumſtance of them.

                     <p>The difference between the Creation of Beaſts and Man cannot be paſſed by without ſpeciall obſervation.

His State, in his Dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein he may be conceived, to be anſwerable to God in Dominion, and Soveraignty. But, if we ſpeake after the manner of the Scripture, the Image of God in man, ſeems moſt properly to imply his Reſemblance, not ſo much in his Nature, as in the Rectitude and Holineſſe thereof; for, now the Image of God in man is defaced, yet the reaſonable ſoul and the faculties thereof continue ſtill, though much empaired.

Beſides, when <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 5.3. is ſaid to beget a Son in his own Image; he begat not an unreaſonable, but onely a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Creature. So that Gods Image, in which man was Created, muſt needs conſiſt, if not ſolely; yet, eſpecially in the Rectitude of his Soul, and of the Faculties thereof, both the Underſtanding, and Will, and Affections: Although it muſt needs be granted, that man drawes nearer to God then any other creature doth, in his Dominion over Gods VVorks, in the Majeſty of his Perſon, and in the Natural Abilities of his mind.</p>

The Second, for the Intereſt which God gave them in the fruits of their Labours: As if he had ſaid, Beſtow your labour in husbanding and manuring the Earth well, for you ſhall eat the fruits of it; ſo that you ſhall labor but for your own good.</p>

                     <hi>To you it ſhall be for meat]</hi> Thus God expreſſeth the uſe of the Herbs, and Fruits, which he had given Man, that they ſhould be for their food: in which clauſe is withall included a ſecret Bleſſing of God upon them, that they ſhould not onely be meat, but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment too. For Herbs, and Fruits, are not preſently nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they are eaten; neither do they prove ſo to all, nor at all times. It is true, that <hi>Man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of Gods mouth,</hi> that is, by his bleſſing upon the bread, which gives it power to nouriſh us. Our nouriſhment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40146:63"/>by food may indeed juſtly be accounted amongſt Gods wonders, much more amongſt his bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>In this, and the next Verſe is clearly ſet before us, both the Goodneſſe, and Provident care of God, in allowing and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of proviſion of food, both for Man, and beaſts, which God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth, to the Dominion given to Man over the Creatures, and that (as we may probably gueſſe) partly to enconrage him, to take care of the Earth, the fruits whereof muſt ſuſtain his life. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to temper his thoughts, in the conſideration of his new dignity; He was to bear rule over the Earth, but he muſt be ſupported by it; he was a Lord, but a Lord that could not ſtand by himſelf, but muſt be ſupported and upheld by the daily food, which was to be ſupplyed unto him, by thoſe very Creatures, that were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</p>
                  <p>But why doth God abaſe Man ſo far, in this his happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to ſupport, and as it were to prop him up, by the Creatures, whereas he might have preſerved Man, as he doth the Angels, by immediate Influence from himſelf, without the help of any Creature at all, and have continued his life, as well without food as by food? It ſeems that God from the beginning, appointed Mans preſent condition in this world, to be an eſtate of abaſement, in compariſon of that glorious condition which was to follow; a ſtep lower then the Angels, although he was Crowned, even at preſent, with Glory and Honour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. For 1. he was here on earth as a Sojourner for a time, to be removed hence to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting habitation afterwards. 2. He was at preſent, although not utterly ſhut out from Gods preſence, yet admitted only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his back-parts, and to enjoy him by meanes, as being unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, in his preſent condition, to behold him face to face, and to ſee him as he is, which he could not do in his fleſh, but was to expect afterwards. Thirdly, as he enjoyed not God on Earth Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: So he was not to be ſupported by him Immediately, but from him, by the Creatures. Laſtly, he ſuffered ſome abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the employment, wherein, while he was to continue on Earth, he was to ſerve him, for the moſt part, in the ſervice of the the Creature, Ordering that, and governing it, according to Gods direction; whereas hereafter all his ſervices ſhall be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately directed unto God, in praiſing and rejoycing in him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: So that it appears evidently many waies, that from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God intended ſome degree of abaſement to Man in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition in this life, reſerving him unto the hope of enjoying the fulneſs of Glory, in the world to come: into which he was to be tranſlated, not by death, but by ſuch a change, as the Apoſtle mentions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. The manner whereof, is neither known, nor curiouſly to be enquired after. From this Conſideration,</p>

Thus hath God ordained it, 1. To hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us in this our ſtate of baſeneſſe, as hath been ſhewed already. 2.

To ſettle our hearts in a right judgment of the emptineſſe, and conſequently of the Inſufficiency of all the creatures, that none of us may reſt our ſelves upon them, which being conſidered a part from God are Nothing, and conſequently can do nothing; and are therefore, neither to be entertained with any extraordinary affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; nor ſought after with any great care, or deſire; nor much leſſe to be reſted on with any firm Confidence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To fill our hearts, with the Apprehenſion, and Meditation of Gods infinite Majeſty, Glory, Power, Wiſdom, All-ſufficiency, Goodneſſe, and Truth. 1. That we may in our hearts advance and lift him up alone, caſting down all his workes at his feet; and we may be ſtill kept in a reverend awe and fear of him. 2. That we may be quickened to all duties of obedience, ſerving that God, with all our hearts, and that with chearfulneſſe, by whom we are, and from whom we have received, ſuch an advancement to be made after his own Image, and appointed Lord over all the works of his hands, and do daily receive ſuch a liberall ſupply of all needfull meanes, for the comfort of our lives. 3. That we may be brought to ſtay our hearts upon God alone, as being both able to provide us all things, ſeeing he made them al; and Faithful and True to ſupport us, and do us good, as a faithfull,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40146:71"/>Creator, and therefore cannot but take care to preſerve all that he hath made, leſt he ſhould have made any thing in vain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To direct us in the Uſe both of our ſelves, and the reſt of the Creatures, what to aym at: which is indeed chiefly the advancing of Gods honour In, and By them, when we diſcover thoſe glorious Attributes of his Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſſe, appearing in the Creation of all things, and ſuſtaining them; and, upon all occaſions, ſpeak of them to his praiſe: But withall, the directing of our ſelves, and all the reſt of the Creatures, in our power, to the preſervation of Community, which is one of Gods Speciall Aimes, in making all the Creatures ſerviceable one to another, and all of them to Man, and in charging him with the care and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them all, that ſo they might be the better carried on to that general End, whereunto God had ordained them. So then a man aiming only at himſelf, or uſing the Creatures only for the ſervice of himſelf, without relation to the Community, perverts the whole Courſe and Order, which God hath ſet in Nature, than which nothing can be more directly oppoſite to Gods Mind and Will, more Injurious to the Creatures, or unprofitable to our ſelves, whoſe good is included in the Common good of all that God hath made.</p>

                     <hi>He reſted]</hi> Not properly; for God being a pure Act muſt needs be alwaies working, and can no more ceaſe to work than to be; Onely in reſpect of the Creation he is ſaid to reſt, or ceaſe, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to do any more: Manifeſting thereby, that he had fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and finiſhed all that he purpoſed and decreed to make: This was Gods Reſt taken Privitively.

                  <p>Thus we ſee God, although he hath power to give what lawes he pleaſeth: yet is pleaſed to manifeſt the Equity of that which he commands, that we may acknowledge his Will to be a rule of Righteouſneſſe. VVhence,</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40146:75"/>Day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. A Day to which no Night is reckoned, as it is to other dayes, as being a Type of that Reſt which ſhall be all Joy and Light, without any mixture of Darkneſſe at all. 2. The Ordaining of it to be a Day of Bleſſings, in Spiritual things, wherein God will pour out Grace into the hearts of his people, in the uſe of his holy Ordinances.</p>

                     <hi>And Sanctified]</hi> Or, ſeparated it, from an Ordinary and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to an Holy and Religious uſe, for his own immediate ſervice, in the exerciſe of Duties of Piety and Religious Worſhip. For whereas to Sanctifie, ſignifies, 1. To make Holy, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. 2. Or to ſet apart to an holy uſe, as it is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.41. 3. To keep holy, or uſe in an holy manner, as it ſignifies, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. &amp; 11.44. 4. To declare to be holy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12. In the two laſt Senſes, men may be ſaid to Sanctifie or Hallow things; In the firſt, it is peculiar to God alone: In the ſecond (in which it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this place) it is appliable both to God and Man: God, by his Law and Commandement; and Man, by his free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary offerings and vowes, appointing things to be ſet apart unto holy uſes, which before were Common.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe in it]</hi> Not ſo much to propoſe his own Example, for our imitation (for God himſelf might Reſt upon ſuch grounds as concern not men) but becauſe Gods Reſt, manifeſting the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the work of the Worlds Creation; that day whereon he reſted, that is, in which the work of Creation was finiſhed and perfected, was the fitteſt to be obſerved in remembrance of that great work: As now the day, in which our Saviour, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, manifeſted the accompliſhment of the work of our Redemption (a greater work then that of Creation) is the fitteſt to be Celebrated in the remembrance of that more Eminent, and more Glorious Work. For otherwiſe, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all dayes are equal; neither is one of them more Eminent, or more Obſervable, then another. The difference of dayes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the Works done, or Events happening upon thoſe daies. A ground which even Heathen men themſelves by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledged, and made uſe of, in obſerving their Feaſtivals. Whence it is that God (who grounds all his Moral Lawes upon Principles, which right Reaſon conſents unto) gives in this, for the Reaſon of Inſtituting that greateſt Feaſtival, limiting it to, and fixing it upon that day, in which he had finiſhed the worlds Creation, ended in Six dayes, and declared to be perfected by his Reſting upon the Seventh. In which number of dayes, he alſo pointed out, as it were, a ſet period of time, according to the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution whereof times might be ever after computed, by Weeks, or Sevens of dayes. So that in that time, in which he made and fully finiſhed the World, he ſet out a Proportion of time, in which that Holy day ſhould be obſerved; and by the perfecting of the World upon the Seventh day, deſigned the very day, which, in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40146:76"/>that revolution of time, ſhould be Conſecrated to Himſelf, and that by the ground upon which it was to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that when this Law was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> being then in the ſtate of Innocency, that ground of the Obſervation of the Day, was appliable to none other but the Seventh, or Laſt day of the Week, becauſe Man continuing in that ſtate, there could not have been ſuppoſed a more Eminent Work of God, then the Worlds Creation. But now ſince his Fall, the work of the worlds Redemption, by which it was not onely Renewed and Reſtored, but beſides more firmly ſettled then before, being more Eminent, and in every reſpect more Beneficial to man, then the Creation; the ſame ground, upon which the Sabbath was by God fixed upon the Laſt day of the week, warrants and directs us to tranſlate it to the Firſt day, where on, by our Saviours Reſurrection, that more Glorious Work of our Redemption was manifeſted to the world, to be fully perfected. Wherefore when God renews this Law of the Sabbath upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Condition of Man being then altered, and a Redeemer promiſed, and expected, God (although he thought it not fit to change the Sabbath, unto another day, till that work ſhould be accompliſhed, which ſhould occaſion the change of it, yet) took ſpeciall care to pen the Fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch expreſſions, that when the time of accompliſhing that work ſhould come, the day might be changed, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the letter of the Law. Wherefore having occaſion, in the fourth Commandement, to alledge the ſame reaſon for the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Sabbath, that he gives here, for the Inſtitution of it, and that in the ſame form of words which he here uſeth; yet, in the concluſion inferred upon that reaſon, he changeth the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular term Seventh unto that which is more General, Sabbath, ſaying, not as here, <hi>Therefore the Lord Sanctified the Seventh Day;</hi> but, <hi>Therefore the Lord Sanctified the Sabbath Day.</hi> Implying, that the time which he required to be obſerved, muſt be one Reſting day of Seven, leaving the Particularity of the day, to be deſigned by the work upon which the obſervation of it was to be grounded; ſo that both the Jews from that ſame Law might have warrant for the obſervation of the Laſt day of the Week; and we that are Chriſtians might have the like warrant for the obſerving of the Firſt day of the Week.</p>
                  <p>Some there are, that conceive theſe words not to contain in them the Narration of what God inſtituted at preſent, but (by way of Anticipation) a manifeſtation of what he Ordained and Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be obſerved in the Law, afterward delivered to his people upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. 20. As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid here, This Reſt of God the Seventh day, was the reaſon why God in the delivering his Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> appointed his People to keep that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day for a day of an Holy Reſt. To whom we anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What ground is there to be drawn out of any Circumſtance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40146:76"/>of the text that enforceth us to admit ſuch an Anticipation, and without ſuch a ground who dare ſuppoſe it? If we may pervert the Order of the Scriptures, at our pleaſure, without warrant from the Letter of the text it ſelf, no Man ſhall be able to draw any binding Argument out of Scripture, to conclude any thing at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Anticipations in Scripture are moſt Commonly, if not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies uſed, that by repreſenting before hand, ſomewhat which was done afterwards, the whole narration might be made more clear and perſpicuous: or at leaſt, that the Occaſion, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of ſuch other things, as are related, might be Conſidered and laid together, that we might the more eaſily, and diſtinctly, obſerve the VVay of God in his VVork. Now in this place to mention the occaſion of that which was done more then two thouſand years afterwards, helps nothing to the underſtanding of any thing there related, and conſequently there is upon that ground, no cauſe of ſuppoſing ſuch an Anticipation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such an Anticipation in this place muſt needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to be utterly ſuperfluous; ſeeing the very ground of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the reſt of the Sabbath, which is mentioned here, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, and wel-nigh, in the ſame words, ſet down in the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Law, given upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Now it cannot be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the Holy Ghoſt, in an Hiſtory ſo ſuccinctly penned, as this is, would inſert any thing unneceſſarily and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such an Anticipation, in this place, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth, that the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written after the delivering of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> for if the Law were not given before the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written, how could this Anticipation here ſhew the reaſon of a Law, which was not then in being? Now that the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written after the Law was given, is impoſſible to be proved; Nay, if conjectures might be admitted, it ſeems more probable that <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written, while <hi>Moſes</hi> was yet in <hi>Midian</hi> before he undertook the bringing up of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for beſides that he was then beſt at leiſure, that Book muſt needs be of ſingular uſe, to encourage the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake their journey into <hi>Canaan;</hi> for which, their Fore-Fathers had forſaken their own native ſoil, which God had ſo many waies made over unto them, wherein they had been ſojourners ſo long a time, and wherein God had ſo wonderfully protected and proſpered them even to admiration, all of them being great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, to enter into the poſſeſſion of ſo good a Land, ſo freely beſtowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Others there are that conceive that thoſe words contain only a narration of what God himſelf did, not what he appointed or ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man to do or obſerve afterwards: and will have the words in the firſt clauſe to expreſſe what God did; He reſted: and in the later
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40146:77"/>to expreſſe how he did it, He Sanctified and Bleſſed (his Reſt,) or kept it as an Holy Reſt.</p>
                  <p>To whom we anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How can God be ſaid to Sanctifie his Reſt in this Senſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Actions and Holines of them cannot be ſevered, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth is Holy, becauſe he doth it? The actions of Men indeed, and the Holineſſe of them be two things, and are many times too far aſunder; but God is holy in all his Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. and in ceaſing from his Works: And therefore to ſay that God Reſted, and that he Sanctified (his Reſt,) is to ſpeak Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly and Superfluouſly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that be the ſenſe of the term Sanctified, how ſhall we interpret the next word, Bleſſed? In what ſenſe God by his own Act of Reſting, may be ſaid to Bleſſe the day of his Reſt, cannot eaſily be imagined: neither do we find any other place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein that phraſe bears ſuch a ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The letter of the Text, and Series of the Narration, ſeem to oppoſe this ſenſe; wherein, we have related unto us three diſtinct Actions of God. Firſt, He made, 2. He Reſted; 3. He Bleſſed and Sanctified the Reſt: And thoſe three are laid down as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another, at leaſt in Nature, if not in Time. Yea, and to be in a ſort the ground one of another; The full perfecting and finiſhing of the Creation, was the ground of Gods Reſting; and his Reſting was the Ground, or Occaſion at leaſt, of Bleſſing and Sanctifying the Day of Reſt; or appointing of it to be a day of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſt. So that as, in the words of the ſecond verſe, He reſted from all the works which he had made, imply the making of the works before the Reſt; ſo, in this Verſe He Sanctified the Reſt, becauſe he had Reſted, muſt needs imply that the Reſt went before the ſanctifying of the Reſt, and to be diſtinct from it.</p>
                  <p>A third ſort there are, that think thoſe words, Sanctified and Bleſſed, to imply, Not what God then did; but what he purpoſed and intended to do afterwards: and parallel, for the ſtrengthening of that conjecture, with theſe words, that phraſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.8. where God ſaith, that he ſanctified and Ordained <hi>Jeremy</hi> to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the womb; which cannot be underſtood of the Actuall Sanctifying of <hi>Jeremy</hi> at preſent; but muſt be conceived to imply what he meant to do afterwards.</p>
                  <p>To this we Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Inſtance out of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> is not clear nor convincing. For, if by Sanctifying we mean Infuſing of Holineſſe; why may not the Spirit of God (if he pleaſe) ſanctifie <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the womb, as well as it moved <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt in the womb. If we underſtand Sanctifying for Deſigning, or ſetting apart to that office, why might not God, as well actually by ſome meſſage to his Parents, or otherwiſe, as well appoint <hi>Ieremy</hi> to be a Prophet in his Mothers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40146:77"/>womb, as he deſigned <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt to the Like office before he was conceived?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a ſtrange Inference, out of that place in <hi>Ieremy:</hi> the Word Sanctified muſt be ſo taken there, becauſe it can have no other Senſe; therefore it muſt be taken ſo here, where it may have another and fairer conſtruction, and more ſuitable to the Circumſtance of the text in this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>To come to the Obſervation, to be gathered out of thoſe words, It is obſervable, that the firſt of all the Lawes recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be given to Man, provides for the eſtabliſhing of his owne immediate Worſhip. VVhence,</p>

                     <p>It will perhaps be anſwered, that ſuch a Reſt was meerly Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, laid upon them by God, as a part of their Ceremoniall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage (and therefore not to be preſſed upon us Chriſtians, whom Chriſt hath freed from that yoak) which they were ſo preciſely to obſerve, that they were forbidden to dreſſe meat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. Or to kindle a fire; <hi>Exod.</hi> 35, 3. upon that Day.</p>
                     <p>We anſwer, we require not the obſervation of any Reſt, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the Jewes by any temporary law, ſuch as were, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints from dreſſing of meat or kindling of a fire on the Sabbath Day; both which it ſeems Continued no longer then their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination in the Wilderneſſe, ſeeing we never read, either of the obſervation of it, or blame laid upon them for not obſerving it afterwards.

And that in one of the cheif Phariſees Houſes, the ſtricteſt obſervers of the Sabbath, even to Superſtition. Now that feaſt could not be prepared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fire; the kindling whereof, if it had been unlawful on that Day, neither would our Saviour have graced the Feaſt with his preſence, nor the Phariſees, that watched him ſo narrowly, and quarrelled with him ſo often, for ſuppoſed Sabbath breaches, have paſſed it over in ſilence. No, we require the obſervation of no other Reſt, then that onely which is expreſſed, in the Fourth Commandement; namely, the laying aſide of all the Labours of our particular callings in ſecular things: that we may ſet a part the whole day of this Holy Reſt, unto God for his immediate Worſhip and ſervice.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed many that conceive, that Chriſtians are not

And particularly they affirm, that there muſt needs be acknowledged ſomething to be Ceremonious and Muta, ble, in the Fourth Commandement; as namely, the obſervation of the laſt day of the week, I which we our ſelves acknowledge to be changed, whence they conclude no binding Argument can be drawn out of that Comandement, to reach us that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                     <p>We anſwer, 1. That it is true that God, in the delivery of his Lawes to the Jewes, looked upon them in divers reſpects. In ſome things, as the people of ſuch a Nation, and of ſuch a Time, which he manifeſted in giving them the Lawes, Judiciall and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. But in giving the Morall Law, which takes in the whole Nature of Mankind: he looked on them as the Body of the Church Repreſentative, to whom therefore he committed not onely thoſe ten Lawes, but beſidesth, e reſt of his Oracles (as the Apoſtle calls them <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.) in truſt for the uſe and ſervice of the Church, which alſo he manifeſted in divers particular Circumſtances. For there can be no probable reaſon given why God; 1. Delivered the Decalogue by the voice and Pen of Chriſt, (the Head of the whole Church) whereas he delivered the Judicialls and Ceremonials by by the voice and Pen of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the peculiar Miniſter of the Jewes. 2. Why, he wrote the Morals in Tables of ſtone; whereas He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Ceremonialls to be written in ordinary Volumes. 3. Why he appointed thoſe Tables to be kept by themſelves in the Ark, within the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> which was as it were, Chriſts own Cloſet, whereas The Judicialls and Cerimonialls, were laid up without the Altar of Incenſe, the Pot of Mannah, and <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod in a Room, into which the Leviticall Prieſts had ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, unleſſe it were to diſtinguiſh thoſe Lawes, which were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Jewes, from thoſe which concerned the whole Church in generall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to the Argument taken from the fixing of the day of Reſt on the laſt day of the week, in the Fourth Commandement. We anſwer; Firſt, that neither in the Summe, nor Explication, nor Concluſion of the Commandement, we have no mention, but of a Sabbath or day of Reſt; in the Explication we have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time appointed for this Reſt, which muſt be one whole day of ſeven, in the Reaſon of the Commandement: there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a rule, that directs us which ſhall be the Day, but that is laid down in Indefinite terms, and is indifferently applyable, to either the firſt, or laſt day of the week? for howſoever the Seventh or laſt day of the week, be there mentioned, as it is here; yet it is not to bind us to it as that particular day, but as a day honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above other dayes, by manifeſting the perfecting of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40146:79"/>red above other dayes, by manifeſting the perfecting of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work of the Creation of the World. So that the rule delivered from the deſigning of the particular day is onely this (as we have ſhewed already in a treatiſe written of this argument) that the day which God ſhall by his work advance above otherda yes, ſhall be the Day of his Holy Reſt: which before Chriſt came, was the laſt day of the week, wherein by his Reſt on that day God manifeſted the perfecting of the Worlds Creation; but, ſince Chriſt, muſt upon the ſame ground, be tranſlated to the firſt, wherein our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by his riſing from the dead on that day, declared the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worlds redemption, which was the more eminent work of the two, and conſequently advanced that day above the former.</p>
                     <p>Secondly we ſay, that having delivered all the reſt of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Lawes, and compiled them into a volume a part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſtinguſhing them from the Morall Lawes, by ſo many Conſiderable Circumſtances, as we have ſhewed already: we cannot in reaſon conceive, that God would leave out onely this one of thoſe lawes, to be mixed with his Moral and perpetuall and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Lawes.</p>
                     <p>As for that Scruple which many ſtumble at, that it appeares, by mentioning in the Preface to the Law, the deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, and promiſing their Continuance in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſed in the fifth Commandement, that God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Decalogue onely to the Jewes; becauſe he mentions thoſe things which concerned them alone.</p>
                     <p>We anſwer: Firſt, that neither of thoſe particulars, in which they inſtance, is any branch of any one of thoſe Commandements, but are only promiſed and annexed as Inducements to move them to yield obedience to thoſe Lawes; Now the duties may belong unto us, though the Inducements and motives to perſwade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto were peculiar unto them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly thoſe very motives, are indeed expreſſed in ſuch a form as is appliable onely to them; but the things intended by thoſe expreſſions, belong as well unto us as unto them. Their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Type belonged only to them; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from our Spiritual bondage repreſented thereby, belongs as well to us as to them. And the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> pointed at in the fifth Commandement, is any Land in the Earth, which God gives any of his Servants, as the Apoſtle clearly Interprets and Applies it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                     <p>There remains yet behind one ſcruple, which hath prevailed with many to doubt, whether the law of the Sabbath were given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, that is, before his fall: becauſe (ſay they) being in that condition he neither needed any ſuch Law, either for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his body, or for the quickening of his ſpirit, nor could poſſibly obſerve it, having no other company but his wife, which could not make a publique Aſſembly, which the obſervation of the Sabbath requires. To whom we anſwer.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40146:80"/>
                     <p> Firſt, that this ſuppoſition, that <hi>Adam</hi> being in Paradiſe needed no Sabbath, is ill grounded; for firſt, the refreſhing of the bodies of men and beaſts, though it be a Conſequent; yet was never the Ground of the Inſtitution of the Sabbath. The moderation of our labours belongs to the eighth Commandement that enjoynes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. As for the quickening of <hi>Adams</hi> ſpirit, why might not he need a Sabbath, as well as a Sacrament? And although every day were a kind of Sabbath to <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of his eaſie labour, and his Holy converſing with God, even in his works about the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet there is great difference between labouring moderately and not at all; And to ſerve God in ordering the Creatures, according to his will, and to ſerve him in the duties of his owne immediate worſhip. So, every day ought to have been ſpent by <hi>Adam,</hi> in an holy manner, but not as a Sabbath: Beſides, though the Sabbath were made for man, yet it was not made for man alone, but principally for Gods Honour in his publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; in which reſpect <hi>Adam</hi> as much needed a Sabbath as we do, being created for Gods Glory as well as we.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as <hi>Adam</hi> needed a Sabbath, ſo he had meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Sabbath; he and his wife when there were no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World made a publick Aſſembly. There is is a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of two or three as well as of a multitude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. And Chriſt is preſent with them as well as with a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Nay, further a man that is ſhut out from publick meetings may keep a Sabbath alone. So then there being no impediment why this Commandement for the obſervation of the Sabbath might not be given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and <hi>Moſes</hi> recording it in the firſt place amongſt thoſe lawes that were then given him, we have no ground to doubt, but that <hi>Adam</hi> had this Law then given unto him; and, in him, unto all mankind. So that we may,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="5" type="observation">
                     <head>5. <hi>Obſerve, The law given by God, for the obſervation of the Sabbath Day, is a law Univerſal and Perpetual.</hi>

                     <p>UNiverſal it muſt needs be; 1. Becauſe in <hi>Adam</hi> it was given to the whole nature of Man, which was intirely in him at that time when he received it. 2. And the uſe as well as the ground of it, reacheth indifferently unto all men, who are alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in all the works that God hath wrought, both of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Redemption, and alike obliged to honour him for them, and have like need of thoſe Spirituall comforts, and refreſhings which the religious obſervation of that brings unto, &amp; ſupports the ſoul withal. Upon the ſame ground it muſt needs be perpetual, for if it bind all men, it muſt of neceſſity bind all ages; which alſo our Saviour neceſſarily implies in his anſwer to the Phariſees
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40146:80"/>queſtion about divorce, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8. wherein he affirms, the divorce ſuppoſed to be permitted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be unwarrantable, becauſe it croſſed the Law of Marriage, given to <hi>Adam,</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; which Anſwer muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe this ground, that whatſoever Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Beginning (thoſe Laws that reſpected his preſent condition, as his Labouring in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and Eating of the Tree of Life, excepted) binds all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all Ages. Beſides, the placing of this Commandement amongſt the precepts of the Decalogue, which our Saviour rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in every jot or tittle of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. further manifeſts the mind of God, for the continuance of this Law, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wills his Diſciples to be careful to obſerve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. even at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 40 years after his Aſcenſion, when all other Mutable and Temporary Lawes were taken away.</p>
                     <p>Nay, although there be this difference between this precept concerning the Sabbath, and ſome other lawes of the Decalogue, that this doth not appear ſo evidently to be a Law of Nature, as they do, yet it muſt neceſſarily be a law of Nature in the greateſt part. As, that there muſt be a time for publique Worſhip, a time of Reſt from other Employments, a fit time, a ſet time, a time that muſt return according to ſome time computed by Weeks, or Moneths, or Years. For all theſe even by the light of Nature Heathen men acknowledged, as is manifeſt by their practice in all Ages and Countreys. Nay, the Creation and Redemption of the World being once revealed, even the light of Naturall reaſon, would have directed men to make choice of thoſe dayes, in which thoſe great works were perfected, for the dayes of obſerving this holy Reſt.</p>
                     <p>Now it muſt needs be granted, that ſeeing the ground of fixing the Sabbath upon the Laſt, or Firſt day of the Week, was the marking out and advancing of thoſe dayes above others by the moſt eminent of Gods Works; therefore mans exerciſe upon thoſe dayes muſt be in the Contemplation of thoſe and the reſt of his works, that our hearts may rejoyce in Him who hath in them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his Infinite Goodneſſe, Wiſdom, and Power.

This Garden was doubtleſſe a large Circuit of ground, as appears by the greatneſſe of the River that watered it, and the variety of Fruits of all kinds with which it was furniſhed.

Howſoever the opinion of thoſe that think that Paradiſe, took in the Circuite of the whole world, can neither ſtand with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Situation thereof, nor with the relation of <hi>Adams</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40146:88"/>expulſion out of it afterwards, to dwell in other parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There he put the man]</hi> Or, appointed him to dwell and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, as in the place aſſigned unto him by God for that purpoſe. Now whether <hi>Adam</hi> were made, out of the Garden, (which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeems to be favoured by that clauſe in his expulſion, that he ſhould go till the ground out of which he was taken) and ſo was brought into it afterwards, or whether he were made in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; this phraſe (of putting) doth not clearly determine, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes no more but that God ſettled, or appointed him to Abide there: whether by continuing where he was, or by removing him thither from another place, it is not determined by this expreſſion. This onely ſeems probable, that God gave man a dwelling apart from the beaſts, to intimate unto him the difference that he put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them, and to mind him of that more excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unto the hope whereof he was reſerved, wherein they ſhould have nothing common with him.</p>
                  <p>It is not in vain, certainly that the Holy Ghoſt in ſo brief an Hiſtory, deſcribes with ſuch variety of Circumſtances, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe and rich furniture of this Garden, which he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for mans dwelling. It may be, to manifeſt the bounty of God to man every way, that we might the more clearly diſcover both the malice of Satan in traducing him to our firſt Parents, as if he had envied unto man that happineſſe unto which he might have advanced him; And withal their folly and impiety in hearkning to his ſuggeſtion, againſt ſo many clear evidences to the Contrary. Whatſoever was the Scope of the Spirit of God herein, we cannot but take notice in the firſt place, that this pleaſantneſſe and fruitfullneſſe of Paradiſe above any other part of the Earth, was from God Himſelf, who is ſaid to plant it and make it ſo.

                  <p>Made the Lord to grow] or, as ſome render it more clearly (had the Lord made to grow) that is upon the third day, when the reſt of the Plants and Trees were created. And the Lord is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially named in this place to point at, both his Goodneſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing: and his Equity in limiting, according to his Own Will, the uſe of that which is every way his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every Tree]</hi> Not every particular Tree, but the kinds of all Trees pleaſant to ſight: the words implying that there was no kind of tree Pleaſant to ſight and good for food, which was not to be found in Paradiſe; though ſome, at leaſt, of diverſe of thoſe kindes might perhaps be found in other parts of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pleaſant to ſight]</hi> The ſmell of the fruits is not here mentioned, but ſeeing the purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt, is to commend thoſe fruits every way, and we find ſome Fruits commended by their ſmell, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.8. We may conceive that alſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as well as the pleaſantneſſe of the ſight, and taſte, which are expreſly named.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good for food]</hi> That is, both pleaſant to the taſte and wholſome to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the body, and ſo to maintain the life: as we ſee uſually the meats that are wholſome and nouriſhing, are for the moſt part, of a gratefull and pleaſing taſte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Tree of life alſo]</hi> Thoſe two trees which God ſeparated from Common to a religious or Spirituall uſe, are expreſly ſaid to be produced by God, as the reſt of the plants were: to manifeſt the Equity of Gods Commandement concerning them, who ſeeing he made them, might either give or detain them at his pleaſure, and limit and appoint them to what uſe he beſt liked. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe two trees were of different kinds from the reſt, or no, is not curiouſly to be examined. This Tree of Life is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged to be a Sacrament, and ſeal of that Covenant by which God promiſed him the Continuance of his Naturall life, during his abode here on Earth, which could not have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but by Gods immediate Power: and the beſtowing of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40146:90"/>life after he ſhould be removed from hence, to injoy the fulneſs of Gods preſence for ever in heaven; which ſome conceive to be the chief benefit intended to be ſealed by that Sacrament. Now if this Tree had beſides a power given it to maintain <hi>Adams</hi> body in fulneſſe of ſtrength without decay, it muſt be acknowledged to have that power by the uſe of it, as Gods Ordinance onely, not as a Natural Inſtrument to work the effect by the very bare uſe of it, but by the uſe of it in faith, apprehending the promiſe annexed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the middeſt of the Garden]</hi> Although that phraſe here uſed ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more in ſome other places, but within, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.48. We render the ſame phraſe according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>He laid up food in the Cities,</hi> expreſſing that phraſe Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; which in ſtrict ſignification ſhould be rendred In the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Citties. Notwithſtanding ſeeing in the Hebrew tongue the Middeſt is the moſt proper ſignification of this Phraſe, we may warrantably render it in the middeſt, and interpret it as we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, to deſign the particular place in the Garden where this Tree ſtood. Which we may conceive to have been purpoſely placed in the middeſt of the Garden, that it might be the more often in <hi>Adams</hi> view, which ſhould be alwaies in his thoughts, as it muſt needs be, when he muſt ſo often paſſe by it either to take his food, or to buſie himſelf in his appointed employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Tree of the knowledge of good and Evil]</hi> Which <hi>Adam</hi> being forbidden to eat of, not for any evill in the Tree or in the Fruit of it; but onely becauſe it was the Will of God to forbid it, his abſtinence from it meerly upon Gods prohibition, might ſignifie unto him that the true bounds of good and evill was onely the manifeſtation of Gods Will, which makes that good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful which he allowes, and Evill which he forbids; So that this Tree which was forbidden amongſt all the fruits which were allowed man for his food, was as it were a mark by which Good might be known from Evill; as one mans land is known from another by the bounds ſet between them in the fields where they lye. The particular place where the Tree ſtood, is not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but when the Woman, Chap. 3.3. names it, The tree in the middeſt of the Garden, we muſt conceive that thoſe two trees ſtood not far aſſunder, as alwaies the Sanctions of the law in promiſes and threatnings, are either expreſſed, or muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to go together.</p>
                  <p>By theſe two Trees then, there ſeems to be repreſented and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out unto us the ſumme of the Covenant between God and Man, of which the promiſe on Gods part, was the beſtowing of all bleſſings upon man, implyed in the figure of the Tree of Life, External, Internal; and Eternal, the life both of Nature and Grace, and that in the perfection of both; and on mans part the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40146:90"/>Covenant was Faith (by which he was to depend on Gods All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and Truth) And Obedience, by which he wholy ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Will of God, to be guided by it in all his waies. Both theſe parts of the Covenant, God thought fit to repreſent unto man, by thoſe outward and viſible ſigns of the Two Trees.</p>
                  <p>This full deſcription of Paradiſe, being the place which God had prepared for man, and aſſigned unto him for his dwelling and employment; with ſuch a particular recounting of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the fruites wherewith he had furniſhed it, and which he allowed man for the comfort of his life; gives us occaſion to</p>

                     <p>This leads again to the conſideration of Gods Providence and Mercy to us, in thoſe things which nature produceth; It is not the Earth, or the Heavens: much leſſe humane culture, but Gods Bleſſing by them that makes the graſſe to grow in our paſtures, the Herbs in our Gardens, and the Trees in our Woods: of which though all the Earth were full, yet our grounds might be empty without Gods ſpeciall bleſſing.</p>

This labour of <hi>Adams,</hi> whatſoever it was, muſt be eſteemed as a part of his Abaſement, although it had this honour mixed withall, that man was therein (as it were) a fellow worker with God, in the way of his Providence, for the conſervation of his Creatures.

                  <p>This labour, in which God exerciſed our firſt Parents, and which he injoynes them, as their task implies their duty towards the Creatures: which as God had put under mans government; ſo, he appoints him to take care of, for their preſervation; doing about them ſuch ſervices, as might conduce the reunto: ſo that we have here laid before us, the foundation of mens particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the ſcope of them: which are ſervices about the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for their preſervation, and thereby for ſupporting of Community: So that, as man in a ſort partakes with God in his Soverainty over them; ſo he might ſome way reſemble Him in his Care and Providence, for their good.

The Heavens, and Sunne, and Moon, and Stars, the Seas, the Windes. That which is a law to all Creatures, to be exerciſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for their mutuall preſervation, is much more a duty unto man: unto which God directs us. 1. By laying a neceſſity upon all Creatures here below, of ſubſiſting by mutuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aſſiſtance one of another; men and beaſts by food, plants by Culture, Cattell by care in ſtoring up proviſion for them, in Summer, to ſuſtain them in Winter. 2. By diſpoſing and placing the Creatures ſo, that without mans labour, they are unſerviceable: as Mettals, Stones, and other Mineralls; yea, oftentimes Soil for manurance of grounds, are placed below, in the bowels of the Earth, where they are unuſeful; thornes we ſee grow in Thickets, where they cumber the Ground; which by mans labour, being ſet abroad, they fence: All kind of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for Cloathing, building, and moſt for food, without labour would be utterly unſerviceable. Few things are indeed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either ſo prepared, or ſo placed, as they may be fit for uſe without Labour. 3. God directs to labour, by making it appear that theſe things by labour are made uſefull, and ſerviceable, which without it would be of little uſe at all: As corn by grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and baking, fleſh by roaſting, or boyling, become good food: VVoole and flax by dreſſing, Spinning, and VVeaving, make us good Cloathing: and generally labour brings in wealth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. and thereby, through Gods Bleſſing, there is profit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.23. Thus the Commandement as it is Generall, ſo it is urged upon men by neceſſity, that men muſt either labour or ſtarve, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. Yea and labour the thing that is good, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Either by Inventing, Directing, or Executing things needfull for the preſervation of the Creatures, and particularly for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Humane ſociety, both in things Naturall and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; This Ordinance of God concerning mans labour (as are all the reſt of his lawes) is both equal and good.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. That by buſying themſelves about the Creatures, they might the better obſerve God in his various works In and By them; that ſo they might yield him his due honour, and quicken their hearts to more chearfulneſſe in his ſervice, and ſettle them in a faithful dependance upon him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That their employments about the Creatures, might keep their hearts both from vain and idle thoughts, and from ſwelling with the apprehenſion of their Lordſhip and Soveraignty over them.</p>

                     <p>Let all thoſe lay it to heart, that delight in Idleneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only walk inordinately, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11. but beſides, corrupt their own minds, deſtroy their bodies, trouble their neighbours, and help to ruin ſociety.

Man may concur with God in the waies of his Providence, and may be a meanes of furthering that which God doth therein, as his Inſtrument, as in multiplying the fruits of the Eatth, by preparing the ground which is to be ſowen or planted, fitting it with convenient ſeed agreeable to the nature of it, and in a fit proportion, and by caſting in the ſeed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Seaſon. 2. The encreaſe that comes by his labour, he may preſerve and lay up, and order in ſuch ſort as it may not periſh or be unneceſſarily waſted; diſtribute or diſpenſe it either to Men or Beaſts, as occaſion or neceſſity ſhall require, and fit or prepare it for Food, Cloathing, Building or the like. But in all this; 1. He makes none of the materials, but finds them ready prepared to his hand. 2. Neither doth he produce the effect that followes upon his work, which is cauſed by the Naturall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which God gives the Creatures to work in ſuch or ſuch a manner. So that in effect man doth but bring them together,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40146:101"/>that they may work one upon another by ſuch abilities as God hath given them; and by that meanes ſets nature on work, and at the moſt is but (as it were) Natures Mid-wife. In the mean time God, 1. Provides all the Materials whereof we make uſe in our imployments, as the Soil, the Seed, the Rain, and Influence of the heavens that cheriſh it; the Timber, the Stones, the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the Wool, the Flax, and the like. 2. The Abilities by which they have ſtrength to produce thoſe effects are meerly from God. 3. The Underſtanding and Wiſdom, by which men diſcern the natures and abilities of the Creatures and their uſes, for which, by well ordering, and diſpoſing of them, they may be made ſerviceable; that alſo is wholly from God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.26. 4. The ſucceſs, and effect of the labour which we beſtow, is the fruit of his bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.12 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.10. So that it is God alone that doth all in All; and man in effect doth nothing but make uſe of ſuch meanes, as God both prepares to his hand, and works by, to produce the deſired effect.</p>
                     <p>Let it then pluck down the pride of all our hearts, who are ſo apt to rejoyce in the works of our own hands, not as in the fruits of Gods Bleſſing, but as in the effects of our own endeavours: and let it check our vain and dangerous Confidence, which makes us truſt in our own wiſdom and power, and burn incenſe to our own net and yarn, that we may aſcribe the ſucceſſe of all our labours about the things of this life unto God alone, who is indeed pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make uſe of our heads, and hands in the Conſervation of his Creatures; but, 1. Rather to keep us doing, then becauſe he needs our help. 2. That finding by experience how little our labours work to the producing of any effect, we might rejoyce in him who worketh all things by his mighty power and not in our ſelves. 3. And thereupon might be taught to depend upon him, and ſerve him; when we obſerve the ſucceſſe of our labours to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his power, and not of any ability of ours. 4. To abaſe and humble us, in buſying our ſelves, about the ſervice even of thoſe Creatures that he hath put under our feet; All which he hath ordained onely for a ſhort time, whereas hereafter all mens labours, as well as all other meanes, ſhall ceaſe with the uſe of thoſe Creatures, which are ſupported by them: and God ſhall be All in All.</p>

This large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Gods Grant, is the more carefully to be obſerved, that we may in the next Chapter, take notice how groſly and palpably God is wronged, both by the Devils captious inquiry (yea becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every Tree</hi>) and by the Womans Scant and Maligne expreſſion of the Grant in her Anſwer to Satan [Of the fruit of the Trees we may eat] Leaving out both the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in this place, that commended the largeneſſe of the Gift; namely, that they were allowed to eat of Every Tree, and to eat Freely.</p>

And for this cauſe God ſingles out a Tree, as Beautifull to the Eye, as Delightfull in Taſte, and good for Food, as any of the reſt; And forbids the man to eate of it, to ſhew that it was no difference in the fruits: but meerly in the Will of God, which made the eating of the reſt lawful, and of this One onely, Unlawful, as we ſhall ſee more fully hereafter, in the next Chapter.</p>

As if the Holy Ghoſt pointing at the common Originall both of men and beaſts, would imply, that though the ſame hand formed them both, and that, of the ſame matter: yet man and the Beaſts were ſo unſuitable in Nature, that amongſt all the Beaſts, there could not be found one that was fit to be mans companion. But howſoever this repetition, may be taken in for a ſupply, unto the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the former Chapter, and diſcovers unto us, that the Fowls alſo were made out of the Earth, a Circumſtance altogether omitted in that pace.</p>

                  <p>

Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he admitted <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> into his ſervice, gave him a name; and when <hi>Pharaoh-Necho</hi> ſet up a new King in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he gave him a new Name, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.4. to manifeſt that he was to acknowledge him to be his Lord; And names amongſt the Hebrewes were uſually given by the Father, who was the Maſter of the Family: and howſoever the Mother was permitted to do it ſometimes; yet, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belonged of right to the Father, appears by <hi>Jacobs</hi> changing of the name <hi>Ben-oni</hi> (which his Mother had given) into <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 35.18. And by the appeal of friends to <hi>Zachary</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the controverſie about <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Name, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.62. Withal, God gave <hi>Adam</hi> thereby occaſion to make tryall of that wiſdom, which he had given him, in finding out fit Names agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Creatures Natures, which required a great meaſure of wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And whatſoever Adam called them,</hi> &amp;c.] This clauſe, we may probably conceive to be added, to manifeſt both the Power, and Wiſdom of <hi>Adam,</hi> in giving the Creatures their names, when that which he did was ratified as unalterable, as being given by him that had power to do it; and had done it with ſuch wiſdom, that there was no cauſe to alter any name that he had given any of them. Certainly the fitting of all the Creatures with names ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their natures, &amp; that upon the firſt view of them, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered the fulneſſe and perfection of <hi>Adams</hi> Wiſdom, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding all that it concerned him to know. As for the language which <hi>Adam</hi> uſed, whether it were Hebrew or ſome other tongue more perfect then it, which is now loſt; it cannot be certainly concluded though it be moſt probably guoſſed, that it was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, which is the moſt Ancient, and moſt Significant of all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages now in uſe.</p>
                  <p>God (as we have heard already) had conſidered mans preſent condition, and found in his Wiſdom, that <hi>Adam</hi> wanted and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fit companion, to make his life every way comfortable to him; and that to do this, there was a neceſſity of making a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This God knew and ſaw, in his infinite Wiſdom; but this was not yet ſo manifeſt to <hi>Adam.</hi> Wherefore, that the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Creating the Woman, might appear to the man alſo, as it was manifeſt unto God, He cauſeth him to take a view of all the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40146:115"/>Creatures, that when amongſt them he ſhould find no fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for Himſelf, he might both diſcern the neceſſity of creating the woman, and withal, the goodneſſe of God in Creating ſo meet an help in her, as all the world beſides could not afford him. Withall, this Circumſtance ſeems to be of ſpecial uſe, to clear God, of thruſting in the woman upon <hi>Adam,</hi> unneceſſarily, as a ſnare to entrap him; when it appeared ſo evidently, that it was meer Neceſſity that moved God to create, and, in compaſſion unto man, to provide him ſuch an help and companion for him as he could neither be without, nor find amongſt all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>In that God, before he Created the Woman, would firſt ſhew <hi>Adam</hi> the neceſſity of ſuch an help, that when he enjoyed her, he might take notice of, and be the more ſenſible of Gods goodneſſe, and mercy towards him in providing ſo fit an help for him: Thence,</p>

                     <hi>ANd the Lord God]</hi> To fix our eyes more fully on God, as the Author of this great mercy in the Creation of the Woman to be mans helper, The Holy Ghoſt entitles him to every Circumſtance obſervable in the forming of her. God ſends the Sleep, he takes out the Rib, He cloſeth up the fleſh in the place of it; He formes the Woman, He brings her to the man. So that there is none to be ſeen in that work, from the beginning to the end, but God alone. Now although all ſleep be from God, yet the Holy Ghoſt in this place notes unto us extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie ſleep, which God caſt upon <hi>Adam</hi> for this occaſion, by his Own Hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſed to fall]</hi> How, it is not expreſſed, nor curiouſly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in to, onely it muſt be acknowledged (which is implyed in the relation) that it was not VVearineſſe by labour, nor Repletion by food, which brought this ſleep upon him, at this time; And therefore muſt be accounted as an extraordinary Act of God, as are all the reſt that follow afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A deep ſleep]</hi> For ſo the Word in the Originall ſignifies, which bound up all his ſenſes; ſuch a ſleep as fell upon <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.12. Whether it were a Trance or Extaſie, as ſome conceive it to have been, is more then can be gathered out of the Text. Such a ſleep it was queſtionleſſe, that took from <hi>Adam</hi> the Obſervation of all that was done, till the work was ended; Some conceive that he was caſt into this ſleep, to take from him the ſenſe of the pain, which the taking out of his Rib muſt needs put him to, as they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40146:118"/>conceive (as if God, that took it out, could not take it out without pain): Others that the work might appear to be wholly Gods; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man was aſleep, while it was done, and that the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Love of God towards him, might the more evidently appear, in providing this help for him while he ſlept; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome moſt probably conceive, that Gods Intention was in this, as in the reſt of his works, to hide the Operation from mans eies, that he might rather ſee What was done, then How it was done, which is the courſe that he takes in all the acts of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto this day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he took one of his Ribbs]</hi> In this, and in the Circumſtance following (of cloſing up of the fleſh inſtead thereof, and framing the woman) the Spirit of God expreſſing only that they were Gods Acts, but forbearing to deſcribe How they were done; in a ſort commands us rather to believe, then to ſearch curiouſly into them. But why a Rib? Some conceive, for the Scituation that it hath in the body; as firſt, that it was taken neither from the head nor foot, to manifeſt that the place of the Wife was to be neither above, nor to be far below, her Husband. Secondly, that it was taken from a place near the heart, to point at the entire and hearty affection, wherewith the man was to imbrace his Wife. Thirdly, becauſe thoſe parts of the body, are covered with the Armes, ſome conceive that it noted both the ſhadowing, and protection of the Wife by the Husband; All are but conjectures and ſo to be taken, and yet may miniſter unto us hints of profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meditation; But beſides it may be profitably conceived, that God made choice of a Rib, becauſe it might be beſt ſpared, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notable maime, or deformity to the body. The Rib by ſome is taken entirely for the whole Rib, both the Bone and the Fleſh belonging thereunto, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> afterwards acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her to be not onely Bone of his Bone, but Fleſh of his Fleſh likwiſe; And a bone he took, not ſo much to point at the ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and untractableneſſe of Women, as ſome imagine; as at their ſtrength and Firmneſſe in help and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And cloſed up the fleſh]</hi> So that it ſeemes, after that, <hi>Adam</hi> wanted one of his Ribs, unleſſe we follow their opinion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath to acknowledge any defect in <hi>Adams</hi> body, ſuppoſe that God in the beginning Created in <hi>Adam</hi> one Rib Supernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, which he took away, when he made the Woman: a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and vain Conjecture. It ſeems more probable, that whereas God might, as eaſily have filled up the place with another Bone, as he did with fleſh; He did purpoſely leave <hi>Adam,</hi> that lively remembrance of the want of a Rib, as a Character in his breaſt, as well to keep ſtill freſh in his mind, the remembrance of ſo great a Mercy from God in Creating him ſuch an help, as alſo to ſet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before him, the duty of embracing his VVife, with hearty
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40146:118"/>affections, that was part of his own fleſh and Bone, taken from a place ſo near unto his heart.</p>
                  <p>After God had made <hi>Adam</hi> to obſerve the neceſſity of Creating the woman, he takes the work it ſelf in hand, and firſt by way of preparation thereunto, caſts <hi>Adam</hi> into a deep ſleep, and then takes out of <hi>Adams</hi> breaſt, the matter of which he formes the VVoman, This deep Sleep God caſt <hi>Adam</hi> into.

For an houſe, as we know, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Art, in a proportion fit for the uſe to which it is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whether this phraſe have relation alſo to the man, who was but, as it were, One ſide of the houſe, till the woman was made, and joyned to him, or (which is more probable) points onely at the perfect frame of the Womans body, being as an houſe well built, and in due proportion, we need not diſpute. We know the Scripture often reſembles mans body to an houſe, <hi>Job</hi> 4.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</p>

                     <hi>And brought her unto the man]</hi> Not as he brought the beaſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to be ſurveyed; but, after he had related unto Him whence ſhe was taken, to give her unto him as his unſeparable companion to dwell with him, and be his Helper. Whether this were performed with ſome viſible repreſentation of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, (as ſome conceive it to be done by Chriſt Himſelf, taking on him the Form of a man, as he did ſometimes after the Fall) or any other way, and with what Ceremony, ſince the Holy Ghoſt hath not expreſſed it, we muſt not enquire. This only we muſt acknowledge, that this bringing of the Woman to the Man, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the full beſtowing of her upon him, that they ſhould live together as Man and Wife, by Gods appointment.</p>

The Formal, to be made a Woman. And the Final, that ſhe might be a VVife and Helper to the Man. Of the VVomans Soul we hear nothing in this place. <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid enough before, in the Creation of the Man, leaving us to conceive, that ſince there is nothing more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning the womans ſoul, than we had heard before in the inſpiring of <hi>Adams,</hi> that ſhe alſo had her ſoul inſpired in the like manner.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And were not aſhamed]</hi> As they had no cauſe, when as yet they had not ſinned, or found any inordinate motions ſtirring in their minds. For, Shame ariſing from a fear of blame, or diſreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome uncomely thing diſcovered in him that is aſhamed, whereof he is conſcious, there could be no ſhame unto a man but by ſome inordinate motion of the thoughts within, ſeeing God made nothing uncomely in it ſelf, or in the uſe of it, and therefore could not be uncomely but by abuſe. So then, thoſe parts of the body whereof we are now aſhamed, become ſhameful, if not by the remembrance of ſin, which we are defiled withall in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation from our Parents, yet certainly by the fear of ſinfull thoughts, or inordinate motions apt to be ſtirred up by the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe objects: from which our firſt Parents in this ſtate of Innocency were free. It was therefore no defect in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (ſeeing ſhamefaſtneſſe is not properly any vertue, but only a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable paſſion; nor that neither, but where there is juſt cauſe of ſhame) ſo that by conſequent the want of ſhame in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> manifeſts their Perfection, that they had in them nothing ſhameful, and not any defect at all.</p>
                  <p>This Circumſtance we may conceive to be added by the Holy Ghoſt, partly, to diſcover more fully the Perfect and Bleſſed eſtate of our firſt Parents, who were ſo comely, that they needed no ornament, being glorious by that beauty which God had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and ſo ſtrong by the perfect conſtitution of their bodies, that they needed no defence: And partly, to make it evident by what means their Glory was turned into ſhame, and their Strength into Weakneſſe, namely, by their Rebellion againſt God through the Suggeſtion and ſubtlety of Satan.

                     <p>Let no man then complain, that when he is drawn away, he is tempted of God, but lay the blame upon his Own heart, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objects or any other Allurements draw him into any ſin, which could work no effect that way, (as appears in the Temptations of our Saviour Chriſt) unleſſe they found ſome matter within to work upon them, ſo that they may well be the Midwife, but can never be the Parent of any ſin.</p>
                     <p>To look back and conſider the Scope of the Holy Ghoſt in this
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40146:128"/>Relation of Mans Condition in his ſtate of Innocency, we ſhall find therein deſcribed unto us,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The large proviſion which God made for him, and freely beſtowed upon him, for the needful ſupport and comfort of his Life every way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Rules and Lawes which God gave him for the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his wayes, in all ſervices, both towards himſelf, and to wards the Creatures which he had put under his feet.</p>
                     <p>The end of both we may conceive to be, to diſcover unto us Gods Abundant Goodneſſe, and Perfect Righteouſneſſe, and Holineſſe, that we might learn to Love, Fear, and depend upon Him alone. Now concerning Gods bounty to Man, the Spirit of God ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, that we cannot but behold it with wonderful admiration, ſet out at full in three reſpects, that it was, 1. Free every way. 2. Large above meaſure. 3. Sufficient to ſupply all mans neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That His bounty was Free, as proceeding meerly out of his own Abundant Goodneſſe, is evident in two things. Firſt, that the Proviſions that God ordained, not only for all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that were to do him ſervice, but for himſelf eſpecially, even that Garden of pleaſures, which he aſſigned him for the place of his dwelling, were prepared before man had any being at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they were beſtowed without any kind of ſollicitation, or requeſt: Even the woman which God created to be his helper, and the Comfort of his life, God foreſaw in his wiſdom that man had need of; and out of his meer love reſolved to provide for him, before man himſelf found his own want of her, much more before he could bethink himſelf how he might procure that which he needed ſo much.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Largeneſſe of Gods bounty is ſet out, in the Pleaſantneſs of the Garden provided and given man for his habitation; In the infinite variety of all ſorts of Fruits wherewith it was ſtored, both for Neceſſity and Delight, all of them planted by Gods own hand. And in allowing man the free uſe of them all, excepting only One Tree, reſerved by God as an acknowledgment of his Soveraignty, and as a Remembrance to man of his duty; In the Inveſtiture of man into his Soveraignty over all the Creatures deſigned unto him in the former Chapter; And laſtly, in Creating and beſtowing the Woman upon him in marriage, a greater help unto him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for his life, then all the creatures beſides could have been.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Sufficiency of the Proviſion, which God made for Man, appears in this, that he had all his wants ſupplied. He want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no poſſeſſions, for the Earth was his Inheritance: No ſervants, for the work which he had to do, was little more then to pluck and eat his own food from the Trees, and to overſee and keep in order the Garden ready planted to his hand: No food, for all thoſe delicate fruits were ready prepared, and allowed him for his diet.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40146:129"/>Houſes and Apparel there was no need of, when there was no deformity that needed covering, no Injury by the weather from which he needed to be defended. Onely there wanted a VVife, both for Propagation, and Society, and that alſo God provides for him, and that ſuch a one, as he acknowledgeth to be every way meet for him, and accordingly rejoyceth in her: So that God ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, till he had furniſhed man every way, with all that his Heart could wiſh, or his needfull Occaſions required.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Lawes and Rules which God gave man to guide himſelf by in this ſtate of Innocency: we muſt take notice, that ſuch of them as are meerly branches of the law of Nature, are here omitted. VVe call them properly Lawes of Nature, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rules diſcovered by the conſideration of the Nature of the Creatures are eaſily found out by the ſtrength of right Reaſon: As if there be a God, Reaſon teacheth that he muſt be worſhipped; and if he be a Spirit, that he muſt be worſhipped in Spirit and Truth. If we have our Being and Education from our Parents, that they muſt be honoured and ſerved. If Words muſt be manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto others of our Thoughts, that then they muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto them, ſo that we muſt ſpeak what we think, even the truth from our hearts, and the like. Theſe being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in all mens hearts by Nature, that is manifeſt to all men by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, are not mentioned in this brief hiſtory, as being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known without relation. The Lawes here recorded are onely ſuch as were added to the Law of Nature by Inſtitution, which the rule of Equity doth not neceſſarily enforce of it ſelf, without Gods command to have it thus or otherwiſe. As though it were of the Law of Nature, that if God muſt be worſhipped, that there muſt be a ſet time, and a time of reſt from other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments appointed for that worſhip; yet what portion of time this ſhould be, and on what day it ſhould be fixed, as that it ſhould be one day in Seven, and the laſt of ſeven; no man could by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon conclude, till God commanded that it ſhould be ſo. That man ſhould take care of the Creatures, and endeavour to preſerve them, eſpecially being appointed for his ſervice, reaſon would preſcribe; but that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould take charge of Paradiſe to keep and dreſſe it, was meerly by Gods Inſtitution, and Command, who might as well have diſpoſed of him in ſome other place, as there, if he had ſo pleaſed. That Gods Will ſhould be mans Rule, and that his Obedience and Faith ſhould be profeſſed and ſhewed forth to others, is a branch of the Law of Nature; but that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould manifeſt his Faith in God, by eating of the tree of Life, and his ſubjection to his Will, by abſtaining from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was only by Gods own appointment, having no other ground but the motion of his own will. That Man and Woman ſhould be joyned together for propagation, and that too in Marriage, may be conceived to be of the Law of Nature:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40146:129"/>But that a man ſhould be bound to one Wife, and that for term of Life, although Natural Reaſon muſt needs acknowledge it to be moſt convenient; yet, becauſe it is not neceſſary, God might have ordered it otherwiſe, if he had been ſo pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever the Reaſon may be conceived to be, why the Holy Ghoſt mentions only theſe Poſitive Lawes, whereas he paſſeth over in ſilence the Laws of Nature, it muſt needs be acknowledged that theſe Laws, which being only Poſitive, have no other foundation but the meer Will of God, are notwithſtanding ſo Equal, and Good every way, that being once made known, natural reaſon it ſelf cannot but approve them; and conſequently the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Holineſſe, and Goodneſſe of God appears more clearly in them, than in thoſe Lawes that being branches of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are in a ſort more Neceſſary; ſeeing nothing diſcovers the man more evidently, then thoſe things wherein he is moſt free to do, or approve what he will. And indeed it may be probably concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Holy Ghoſt had this ſcope, to manifeſt the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in giving theſe Lawes, becauſe they are ſo recorded, that the Equity of them is withall manifeſted by ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or other, inſerted into the Relation. The Equity of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath unto the laſt day of the week, appears in manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that That day, being honoured above the reſt, by putting an end to, and declaring the perfecting of the Works of Creation, was the fitteſt day to be obſerved in remembrance of ſo glorious a work. And the Law of appointing man to labour in Paradiſe, is manifeſted to be equal, by this, that God gave him the uſe of all the fruits in Paradiſe, ſo that he did but labour for himſelf. That the Interdiction of the Tree of Knowledge might appear to be equall, it is recorded withall, that God gave Man all the reſt of the fruits to make uſe of, freely. The ſame is as clearly manifeſted, in ſetting down at large the Law of Marriage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Holineſſe of theſe Lawes appears as well as their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Sabbath, Sacrament of the Tree of Life, and reſtraint from the Eating of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the furthering of Faith, and Obedience, and the raiſing up of mens hearts to an holy delight in God, and enjoying an holy Communion with him. Mans labour, tending to the exerciſing of Love and Mercy towards the Creatures, and Marriage to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutual edification in Piety, and Godlineſſe, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an holy ſeed, as it is plainly expreſſed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Goodneſſe of theſe Lawes to Man is as Evident as all the reſt. What can be imagined more Comfortable to man, then the refreſhing both of his Body and Mind, by ceaſing from his labour, and enjoying an holy Communion with God in his Ordinances, in the Religious obſervation of the Sabbath day? more Neceſſary and Uſefull to the ſupporting of his heart by Faith, by the help of that Sacramental Tree of Life? and minding him of his Duty of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40146:130"/>Obedience by the Interdicted fruit, whereby he might continually be ſtirred up to thoſe holy Duties, by Outward Senſible Objects, ſet alwayes before him, even in his ordinary and daily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? What more profitable to him then to labour for his own food? What more Comfortable and Neceſſary to him then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, affording ſo many fit helps unto him for the Support and Comfort of his Life?</p>
                     <p>In General, We cannot otherwiſe conceive, but that the record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Gods Lawes given to man, as well as all his Works both of Creation, and Adminiſtration of the Creatures, aime at the main end wherefore all things were made, and man eſpecially endued with Wiſdom and Underſtanding, that he might take notice of, and be a witneſſe of the All-ſufficiency, and Eminent Perfections of God, and the Baſeneſſe and Emptineſſe of the Creatures, yea, even of Man himſelf the moſt Excellent of all his Viſible Works.</p>
                     <p>We may therefore obſerve in this Record of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the Lawes given to Man, not onely both the Goodneſſe, Equity, and Holineſs of God, together with his Abſolute Soveraignty, and Authority, in preſcribing, and giving Rules to man meerly according to his own Will, beſtowing on him, and detaining from him what he pleaſed, and appointing him to be where he appointed, and to do what he Commanded; but withall, the whole Relation layes before us the Vanity, Subjection, and Emptineſſe of all the Creatures, and man eſpecially; that God might be honoured alone, and all things elſe abaſed before Him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we muſt obſerve, That as all other Creatures, ſo Man himſelf was nothing at the firſt, and after that a piece of baſe dead earth, till God breathed the breath of Life into him; which he is directed to acknowledge, in the remembrance of his Creation, in obſerving the Sabbath, and Eating of the Tree of Life, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dependance on God for his life both preſent and future. 2. His Subjection unto Gods Will, by which he was wholly to be guided, was manifeſted in his Abſtinence from the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, meerly upon Gods Command; implying, that he had no power to order his own wayes, no not in the ſmalleſt things, wherein he was to guide himſelf only by that rule which God laid before him. 3. His Weakneſſe and Vanity was in a lively manner repreſented to him, in making uſe even of the baſeſt Creatures for the ſupporting of his Life, which he had alſo by Gods allowance; And in his finding of the uncomfortableneſſe of his life, by the want of a fit Companion, till God Created the Woman, and gave her unto him; ſo that he had nothing of his own but what was freely beſtowed on him by God Himſelf. So that the advancing of Gods Honour, and Self-denial, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to be the main end of giving man theſe lawes, as well as they are of all the reſt of Gods Works.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40146:130"/>
                     <p> Now ſeeing man was confined unto this preſent world but only for a time, as being at preſent in ſome ſort ſhut out from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fruition of God, who communicated himſelf unto him moſt by the Creatures, and by ſecond means, ſo that man, in his moſt perfect Condition in this world, remained in a ſtate of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in compariſon of that Glory which he was to enjoy at full, after the end of this time of his pilgrimage; We may obſerve, both in the courſe of Gods providence, and eſpecially in the Laws which he gave the man, that God ſo ordered all things, that man might be ſenſible of his preſent mean condition, repreſented to him ſo many wayes, and thereby have his thoughts raiſed up to the Expectation and Longing after that more glorious eſtate, which was to come, ſealed unto him in the Sacrament of the Tree of Life, and ſhadowed out in ſome ſort in the enjoying of God in his Ordinances, and ſequeſtring himſelf from the world, in the obſervation of the holy reſt of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>In effect, the Scope of this and the former Chapter are in a manner all one; as we may eaſily obſerve by that which hath been ſpoken already, namely, the Advancement of God alone, with the Abaſement of all the Creatures before him: which God hath appointed to be our chief ſtudy in this Life, as it ſhall be our greateſt happineſſe to diſcover and rejoyce in it fully, in the Life to come.</p>

The devil (as it may be gueſſed) forbearing to preſſe the temptation, till it might be ſtrengthened by the view of that pleaſant fruit, to the eating whereof he intended to allure our firſt Parents. The rather, becauſe all his hope of prevailing ſtood in the ſuddenneſſe of the aſſault, by which the woman being ſurpriſed una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and at an inſtant, overlaid with all the Art and Power which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could uſe, before ſhe could recollect her ſelfe, might be overtaken and conquered, unto which how much the view of that pleaſant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject conduced, appears by the enſuing Narration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. <hi>Now]</hi> or, <hi>But,</hi> as ſome others render it; for although that particle <hi>(Va)</hi> very frequently ſignifies <hi>And;</hi> yet in this place it ſeemes rather to be, if not an Adverſitive, yet at leaſt a Diſcretive, then a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive particle, (as it is alſo taken in the firſt verſe of the former Chapter,) As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, Thus we ſee how God had every way manifeſted his Goodneſſe and Bounty towards man, not ceaſing to heap upon him bleſſings upon bleſſings, till he had made him perfectly happy: And thus man continued in a bleſſed condition, till he was perverted by Satan, to his own deſtruction: But how he fell away from God, to the utter ruine of himſelf and his poſterity, unleſſe the Lord, out of his abundant mercy and compaſſion had reſtored him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, will appear in the enſuing Narration. Thus when the Holy Ghoſt had repreſented God, acting his part, in Holineſſe, Mercy and Truth, he brings in the Divel on the Stage, walking contrary to God, in a courſe of malice, ſubtilty and falſhood, to overthrow and pervert the order of all that God had made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Serpent]</hi> The Hebrew name, (coming from a word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to obſerve ſubtilly or wittily) might be applied indifferently, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the beaſt it ſelfe, or to Satan that ſpake by it: But the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Serpent with other beaſts of the field in this place, and the kinde of the curſe which was laid upon him afterwards, diſcover him to be a true Serpent indeed; of which creature why the Devil made choice above the reſt we ſhall ſee anon. For the preſent, it may juſtly be enquired, why <hi>Moſes</hi> names only the Serpent, and makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil at all, who was the principal Agent, and made uſe of the Serpent only as the Inſtrument in this deſigne. The reaſon hereof we may gueſſe to be twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe there had been hitherto no mention made of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of thoſe inviſible ſpirits, or of their Fall, (the intention of <hi>Moſes</hi> being (as it ſeemes) to relate only the Hiſtory of the Viſible World) the name of the Divel is not mentioned here, becauſe nothing had been ſpoken of him before: and the rather, becauſe though he be not named, yet he muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to be the Author of this whole Diſcourſe, between the Serpent and the Woman, which could not poſſibly be framed by an irrational creature. And ſeeing Satan is called in other places, (as namely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. and 20.2.) by the name of a Serpent, we may in this place, under that name Serpent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40146:132"/>both the Beaſt and the Devil, who uſed him as his Inſtrument, ſeeing both are called in Scripture by the ſame name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> his intention being principally to clear God of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any hand in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, thinkes it fitteſt to lay before us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the viſible paſſages of the temptation, as namely what was uttered, and by whom, (as being moſt manifeſt in themſelves, and conſequently the ſtrongeſt evidences for the clearing of that truth) leaving the ſecret paſſages, which could not ſo eaſily be diſcovered by ſenſe, to our gueſſe; as the inviſible Author of the temptation, the motions of the womans heart againſt God, and the ſeveral thoughts which affected her minde, which, being not ſubject to outward obſervation, might be eaſily affirmed, but hardly proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More ſubtile]</hi> The Serpents ſubtilty is mentioned elſewhere, both in Scripture, and in other Authors, which ſome conceive might have been greater before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, then now it is, ſuppoſing that beſides the general decay which came upon all creatures thereby, God might juſtly take away, or at leaſt impaire the natural abilities of this creature above the reſt, being employed by Satan for mans deſtruction. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Serpents ſubtilty to be never ſo great, yet ſeeing it could not be a reaſoning or diſcourſing ſubtilty, which way could Satan make uſe of that for the perſwading of a reaſonable creature? If there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authour of ſuch an opinion, or if the word in the Original did any way favour it, a man might probably gueſſe, that the Serpents ſubtilty here mentioned, was only his aptneſſe to ſlide and convey himſelfe cloſely into Paradiſe, uneſpied of <hi>Adam</hi> or his wife, till a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty preſented it ſelfe to give the onſet; for we call them ſubtile men, who walk ſecretly and unſeen in all their wayes. But that we leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Readers conſideration, rather propoſing this as a gueſſe, then preſcribing it to be embraced as a certain truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaid]</hi> That is, Satan by him (if under the name, Serpent, we underſtand both the Agent and the Inſtrument) ſeeing it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the Devil framed both the voice and the diſcourſe, as God did afterwards when he ſpake to <hi>Balaam</hi> by his Aſſe. Notwithſtanding the voice is aſcribed to the Serpent, becauſe no other Authour of it appeared to the woman. But why doth the Devil make uſe of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures voice, when he might have ſuggeſted all that the Serpent ſpeakes without a voice, (as he did to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. and doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to Gods children, as well as to wicked men) and by that meanes hath been leſſe diſcovered? Whatſoever Satans policy was therein, we may probably conceive, that God purpoſely over-ruled him in his way, to the end, that the whole courſe of the temptation being carried on openly, and made ſubject to ſenſe, it might be made manifeſt to the world, that this ſuggeſtion came neither from God, nor from any evil diſpoſition of minde that God created in man, but only from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ſubtilty of Satan, who having fallen away from God himſelfe, deſired to draw in man to be a party with him in his rebellion; partly, out of envie againſt God, and partly, out of malice to man. Withal it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40146:133"/>cannot be denied, but that the weakneſſe of ſo contemptible an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt needs diſcover mans infirmity, who was maſtered by ſo baſe an enemy, and withal aggravate his ſinne, in obeying the voice, and believing the word, of one of the meaneſt of his own vaſſals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the peremptory Command, and faithful Promiſe of his own Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the woman]</hi> Alone, as it is moſt probable, that he might the more eaſily prevaile againſt her, whereas two might have withſtood him, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.12. And to the woman rather then to the man, as conceiving her to be the weaker veſſel. Now if beſides, we ſhould imagine (as ſome do) that this Interdiction of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was delivered by God himſelf only to <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him to the woman, then had Satan yet another advantage againſt the woman, in gain-ſaying that which ſhe had received only upon her husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and not immediately from Gods own mouth. But it ſeemes more probable, that the Interdiction was delivered unto them both by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea]</hi> Or, is it true indeed; or, is it poſſible? ſo that it may be a ſpeech, either of doubting, or of indignation, or of admiration, tempting the woman to queſtion, either the truth, or at leaſt, the equity of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction. Withal, that expreſſion ſeems to have relation to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Conference that had paſſed between the Serpent and Woman, not mentioned in this Hiſtory, wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> contenting himſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the diſcovery of the point of that fiery dart, which wounded our firſt Parents to death, omits both the entrance into, and other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that paſſed between the Woman and the Serpent before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath God ſaid]</hi> It is not without ſome ſpecial aime, that Satan que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, whether this Interdiction were given by God or no. Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to imply from the very Name of God, either the improbability, that God, ſo good and kinde in himſelf, as having planted this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Garden of purpoſe for man, and beſtowed it freely on him, ſhould deny him the uſe of any fruit therein: Or (if it were true that he had ſo done) the indignity, that God ſhould deal ſo unkindly with man, as to plant trees of purpoſe to anger him, that he might have that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in his eye, which he might not enjoy: yea, and ſo far to envie mans good, as to deny him the uſe of the fruit, which only had the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to make him truly happy, and which he might as eaſily have given him as he had made it: And beyond this, to deal ſo deceitfully with him, as to make ſhew of giving him much when in the mean time he had denied him that fruit, by which only he might receive that true good which was proper to a man to make him wiſe, as he tells him afterwards, and that alſo wittingly, as well knowing the great vertue of that fruit to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the Garden]</hi> Every, is a word of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous ſignification, and may indifferently denote, either One, or Some, or All the trees, ſo that we may underſtand them thus, Is any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40146:133"/>tree forbidden you? Or thus, are there ſome trees denied unto you? Or thus, is every, that is, are all trees of the Garden withheld from you? Thus begins Satan to treat warily and cunningly with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, diſcovering neither his malice againſt God, nor his miſchievous intention to man, at the firſt, but keeps himſelf aloof off. In the firſt place, not ſo much affirming as enquiring; and next, propoſing the termes of this enquiry ſo ambiguouſly, that if he were challenged for dealing maliciouſly with God, in queſtioning why he had forbidden man the eating of ſome or of all the trees, whereas he had forbidden but one, he might anſwer; that by every tree he meant no more, but any one tree, and yet the expreſſion might be ſuch, as might point either at more, or at all, that thereby Satan might further his end the better, in amplifying the reſtraint as much as might be, as if God had withheld much, or in effect All, from man, that ſo the womans ſpirit might riſe the more againſt it, as if that which God had granted were inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in compariſon of that which was withheld.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. <hi>And the woman ſaid]</hi> That ſhe feared not the Serpent we need not wonder, ſeeing there was at that preſent no enmity amongſt the creatures, and therefore there could be no cauſe of feare, where was no appearance of danger. But ſeeing the woman knew, that the Serpent could not be the Authour, either of the voice or diſcourſe, how is it that ſhe ſuſpects not ſome fraud? for that this could not be the voice of God muſt needs be evident unto her, becauſe the whole ſcope and frame of the diſcourſe diſcovers the contrary. The Serpents voice ſhe muſt needs conclude it could not be, becauſe ſhe being created perfect in wiſdome like her husband, muſt needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, at leaſt ſo much of the creatures, as to know that beaſts of themſelves were not capable of ſpeech or reaſon If ſhe gueſſed it to be Satan, and knew him to be an enemy; why doth ſhe hazard her ſelf upon a manifeſt danger, to entertain conference with one that hated her? If ſhe knew nothing of him or his diſpoſition, how is it that ſhe opens her ſelfe ſo freely to a perſon unknown? The woman certainly diſcovers ſome unadviſedneſſe, in entertaining conference with the Serpent, in matters of ſo great importance, in ſo familiar a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We eate of the Trees]</hi> The woman ſeems to be ſhaken, and to give ground at the firſt encounter, as we may probably gueſſe; Partly, by Satans bold reply to this anſwer of hers, wherein he chargeth God with falſhood in expreſſe termes, which, in all likelihood he durſt not have done, if the womans own words had not given him ſome encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereunto, conſidering how warily he ſpeaks of God in his firſt queſtion. Beſides, we may diſcover it yet more apparently, in the very forme of the anſwer it ſelf in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when ſhe mentions Gods grant unto them to eat of the trees of the Garden, there ſhe paſſeth over Gods Name, as if ſhe had no great minde to take notice of his liberality, in beſtowing on her ſo large a gift. But when ſhe mentions the reſtraint, there ſhe remembers his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40146:134"/>name expreſly, as if ſhe meant to take no more notice of God in his mercies, but only to quarrel at his reſtraint and interdiction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when ſhe recounts the grant of eating the reſt of the fruits, ſhe ſpeaks of it coldly, and without affection. For whereas God gave man liberty to eat of all the trees of the Garden, and that freely and fully (as the expreſſion in the Original <hi>(Eating thou mayest eate)</hi> implies) ſhe leaves out both thoſe clauſes, and in a very ſparing manner, only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that they did eat of the trees, and addes no more. But when ſhe comes to mention the reſtraint, that ſhe layes down in the ſtricteſt termes that ſhe can think on, which ſuppoſeth ſome riſing of her ſpirit againſt it, if it be true, that mens expreſſions are any indications of the affections within, for that the Holy Ghoſt relates things partially, it were blaſphemy to imagine. Wherefore, ſeeing ſhe ſleights the grant, and ſets out the reſtraint in ſo full a manner in her words; we have reaſon to conclude, that ſhe ſo thought both of the one and the other in her heart, as ſhe repreſents them in her ſpeeches, having a low eſteem of Gods large liberality, in the grant of eating of all the trees, and grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the interdiction from eating of that one. Beſides we finde, that upon Satans reply to this anſwer, the woman turnes wholly away unto the creature, which ſhe could not do, unleſſe ſhe had firſt departed from God; which we may probably conceive is deſcribed, or at the leaſt intimated in this verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is in the midst of the Garden]</hi> By this anſwer it is evident, that this phraſe <hi>(in the midſt)</hi> cannot be taken largely; for <hi>(within)</hi> as it is in ſome other places of Scripture, (as namely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.48. that we render <hi>(in the Cities)</hi> is in the Original <hi>(in the midſt) of the Cities)</hi> but more properly and diſtinctly, for the particular place in which that tree ſtood, ſeeing the woman by this expreſſion diſtinguiſheth it from the reſt of the trees of the Garden. This <hi>Middeſt</hi> here mentioned, we muſt underſtand within a certain latitude, becauſe the Tree of life is ſaid in the former Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. to be <hi>planted in the midſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> near unto which it ſeemes this tree was placed, and was it which the woman meant in this place, becauſe that only was the tree of which ſhe was forbidden to eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God hath ſaid]</hi> Whether ſhe anſwers the Divel to that particular that he points at in his queſtion, whether ſhe was ſure that it was God that had forbidden the eating of that tree (ſo that it is as if ſhe had ſaid, yea, it is God himſelf that hath forbidden, not only the eating, but the very touching of that fruit) or whether ſhe is moved to name God, not ſo much in ſatisfaction to Satans queſtion, as out of a diſtaſte of his ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction, it is not much material; Queſtionleſſe, when ſhe expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentions his name in the reſtraint, and paſſeth by it in the grant of all the reſt of the trees in the Garden, ſhe cannot but be conceived to diſcover ſome unkinde thought of God, of whom ſhe ſeemes to take no notice at all in ſo free and large a grant, which if ſhe had valued as ſhe ought, ſhe might, and in juſtice ought to have cleared God in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, acknowledging both the equity of God in interdicting the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40146:134"/>uſe of one tree, when he had ſo freely granted them all the reſt, and her ready and willing ſubmiſſion thereunto, eſpecially ſeeing alſo the whole Garden was of Gods own planting, and therefore it was free for him to grant or withhold what he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither ſhall ye touch it]</hi> Of this clauſe we finde no mention in the relation of the interdiction, recorded in the former Chapter, whether that clauſe was left out by God in the delivery of that Law, or by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in recording of it, it is uncertain. Howſoever, we may probably conceive, that if that clauſe was not expreſſed in giving the Law, yet the woman might conceive it to be implied: But admit ſhe did, it was more then ſhe needed to have added, in her anſwer to the divels queſtion, who enquires only of the reſtraint from eating, and not from touching or handling; ſo that ſhe may juſtly be conceived, in this voluntary expreſſing of more then was demanded, to diſcover ſome diſcontent and propenſion, to grudge and complain of Gods hard deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her and her husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt ye die]</hi> Some adde peradventure, and it is true, that that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>Pen,</hi> in the Original ſignifies ſometimes only the likelihood or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of an uncertain Conſequent. Take it how you will, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly, that the woman, expreſſing the curſe in a phraſe ſo much different, and ſo much weaker then that wherein God had delivered it, gives great cauſe of ſuſpicion, that ſhe entertained not that ſharp threatening of ſo heavy a judgement, with that feare and trembling of heart that ſhe ought, ſeeing ſhe could not but ſpeak of it, as her heart was inwardly affected by it, and conſequently diſcovereth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of her heart, in not firmly believing that certain truth of Gods judgement threatened in caſe of her tranſgreſſion, of which ſhe ſpeaks ſo ſlightly and doubtfully; whereby ſhe gives encouragement to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his reply, to deny that flatly and peremptorily, which ſhe believes ſo weakly; as being aſſured by one aſſault more, wholly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that which began to totter already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>And the Serpent ſaid]</hi> Watching more diligently to catch ſomething from the womans mouth, then ever <hi>Benhadads</hi> Meſſengers did from <hi>Ahabs,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.33. And perceiving that the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to ſtagger and give ground, he renews his aſſault with the more violence, as we ſhall ſee by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die]</hi> The forcible forme of ſpeech uſed by God which the woman had omitted, Satan takes up, perhaps not without ſome deriſion; as if he had ſaid, yea, I know you are threatened death; certain death, yea, death in the higheſt degree, if you will be ſuch fools as to believe God. It muſt needs then be granted, that Satan relating the curſe more exactly according to the forme wherein it was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the woman had done, knew it well enough beforehand, as being queſtionleſſe preſent when God denounced it at firſt: whereat we need not wonder, ſeeing we know how diligently he watcheth God in all his wayes, and his children in all his diſpenſations towards them, as appears in the Hiſtory of <hi>Job;</hi> which if <hi>Eve</hi> had well obſerved, ſhe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40146:135"/>might have had juſt cauſe to ſuſpect Satans dealing with her in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of her, that which he knew before hand as well as her ſelfe. And withal, it manifeſtly diſcovers Satans impudency in contradicting that, which he knew God had uttered with his own mouth, and that to the woman her ſelfe, who had heard it as well as he. But he well knew that he could now ſpeak no more then the woman was ready to believe. And beſides, he takes the more liberty to deny that which God had affirmed, becauſe no man had hitherto by trial had experience of the contrary by the execution of that curſe which God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened: And therefore ſeeing there was no meanes to convince him of falſhood, he takes the more boldneſſe to gain ſay that upon his word, which God had affirmed only upon his Word: Hoping that his Nay might prevaile as much with ſo favourable a hearer, as Gods Yea could do, when there was no meanes to determine the point in difference, but the credit of the perſons that affirmed and denied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. <hi>But God doth know]</hi> Whatſoever he ſpeaks or affirmes to the contrary. This circumſtance the divel urgeth with great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (if the tree were believed to have any ſuch vertue) that God who made the tree could not be ignorant of the nature of his own work; and enforceth with great advantage for the furthering of his main end, to take off mans heart from God, if it were aſſented unto as true, for then God muſt be charged with two fearful evils. The firſt of envy to man, to whom he ſo ſeverely interdicted that which he knew to be ſo beneficial unto him. The ſecond, of notorious falſhood divers wayes. Firſt, in affirming that which he knew to be untrue. Next, in doing it in the delivery of his Law, whereas Lawes, above all things, ought to be Oracles of Truth. Laſtly, in caſting this interdiction as a cloak over his envy to man, pretending to be tender of his ſafety in forewarning him of a danger, when indeed he uſed it (as he makes the woman believe,) as a ſcar-crow to deterre him from ſeeking his owne good. Theſe horrible blaſphemies againſt God, involved in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Satans contradicting his truth, we ought to obſerve the more heedfully, that we may accordingly proportion and value the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſin of our firſt Parents, in aſſenting unto and believing them, that we may the more juſtifie God in the judgements inflicted on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in that day]</hi> Alluding again to Gods threatening, <hi>that in the day wherein they ſhould eat of the fruit forbidden, they ſhould die the death,</hi> and therein not only contradicting God in every circumſtance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as God by threatening the ſpeedy execution of the curſe, deterrs man more effectually from acting the ſinne; ſo Satan more ſtrongly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures him to attempt it, by promiſing a ſpeedy reward. Beſides, by this meanes he endeavours to gain ſome credit to his words, becauſe it would quickly be tried, whether he ſpake truth or no, and therefore it might ſeem incredible, that he would lie in that wherein he might ſo ſpeedily and certainly be diſproved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your eyes ſhall be opened]</hi> An ambiguous ſpeech, (as are all the reſt of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40146:135"/>Satans Oracles) which proved true by lamentable experience (although in a far other ſenſe, then that wherein the devil deſired to have it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) which moves the Holy Ghoſt to expreſſe the event after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the ſame phraſe, affirming that their eyes were opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it was only to behold their own ſhame and miſery. Now in this expreſſion, beſides the repreſenting of the benefit, which the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this fruit would bring them, Satan chargeth God by the way, that he had all this while kept man hood-winked, and thereby ignorant of thoſe things which he might, and which it concerned him to know. In the mean time, Satan doth that indeed, wherewith he chargeth God falſely and maliciouſly, dazeling the eyes of our firſt Parents ſo much, with the brightneſſe of that glorious condition unto which he promiſeth to advance them, that they overſaw and took no notice of that large meaſure of wiſedome and knowledge, wherewith God had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched their mindes in all things that it concerned them to know, and thereby ſo blinded them in this action, that they underſtood not what they went about till they were utterly undone, like the Syrians whom <hi>Eliſha</hi> led, that knew not whither they went, till they found themſelves in the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ye ſhall be as Gods]</hi> Or Princes, or Angels, as the ſame word ſometimes ſignifies. Thus having repreſented unto them the benefit that they ſhould receive by rebelling againſt God, he now enlargeth it by laying before them a patterne of their happineſſe, wherein they ſhould equal even God himſelf, and by this enflames their hearts and diſtempers them. It may be withal, that he conveighs into the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans minde ſome ground of hope of attaining to this glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing they ſaw a patterne of it in God himſelf, and therefore might hope that it was poſſible to be enjoyed. It is out of queſtion, that he caſts into her thoughts of diſcontent againſt God, by repreſenting their condition ſo far below that which it might have been (as he perſwades the woman to believe) joyned with much unthankfulneſſe for that which ſhe had received already at Gods hand (the creating of him after Gods own Image, ſoveraignty over the reſt of the creatures, the planting and free beſtowing of that pleaſant Garden, with all the fruits thereof, and the inheritance of the whole world) with a deſire to riſe higher, that ſhe might be a match unto God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing good and evil]</hi> Whether he alludes to the name given to that tree, given by God himſelf, it is not certain; if he do, it is to ſtrengthen what he had before affirmed, that God knew well enough the vertue of that tree, as appears in the very name which he had given it; The Promiſe it ſelf which Satan makes is frivolous, if it be duly weighed. Good they knew already, and what could they gain by the knowledge of evil, wherewith they had nought to do?</p>
               <p>We have then here laid before us in brief, that temptation by which Satan foiled, and without Gods infinite mercy had for ever ruined our firſt Parents, with their poſterity, as will appear in the ſequel, and it is by <hi>Moſes</hi> only briefly pointed at, and not diſplayed at large, and is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40146:136"/>therefore by us to be ſcanned and ſearched into the more exactly: Partly, becauſe it nearly concernes us to know the meanes, by which all thoſe evils, under which all mankinde labours unto this day, came firſt into the world, eſpecially, ſeeing thoſe Engines, wherewith Satan aſſaulted our firſt Parents, are the patternes according to which all the reſt are forged, wherewith he fights againſt us continually, even to this day: And partly, becauſe we may be aſſured that this temptation was the Divels maſter-piece, wherein it concerned him to make uſe of the depth of his policies, as having to encounter an adverſary; Firſt, made perfect in wiſdome and holineſſe, and withal filled with Gods love, kindled and confirmed by ſo many freſh experiments of his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant favours and mercies, and now walking in a courſe of perfect obedience. Secondly, Satan was to encounter him meerly with his own ſtrength aſſiſted neither by luſts within; nor by any allurements, or other inſtruments without. Thirdly, he had to deal in a matter of great difficulty, namely, to ſet man againſt that God that had made him, and had compaſſed him with infinite variety of bleſſings, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver provoked him by the leaſt diſcourteſie. Nay, againſt that God upon whom his happineſſe ſtill depended, and who was able eaſily to deſtroy him, by the ſame power by which he had created him, or make him as miſerable as he had made him happy. Fourthly, he was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a matter of infinite conſequence, upon the good or ill ſucceſſe whereof depended the happineſſe or utter deſtruction of all mankinde, the weakening of Gods Kingdome, and the advancing and enlarging of the Kingdome of Satan. And laſtly, he was to adventure upon an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, to be carried through at this preſent aſſault, or not at all. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood the firſt brunt, and by uſe and experience been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and confirmed in that ſtate of Innocency and Holineſſe, wherein he then ſtood, having once diſcovered Satans nature and ſcope, he had afterwards, in all probability been attempted in vain. It will therefore be of good uſe, to take in ſunder this dangerous engine, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral parts of which it is compoſed, and the Art wherewith it is framed, and to that end to take notice of,</p>

                  <head>Of Satans end and ſcope in this temptation.</head>
                  <p>It cannot be queſtioned, but that Satan, being according to his name, an <hi>Hater</hi> both of God and man, aimed both at Gods diſhonour, and at mans overthrow, in this attempt of his, and well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mans adherence unto God was the meanes both of his glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God (whoſe alſufficient goodneſſe he ſealed unto by faith, and whoſe abſolute Soveraignty, Righteouſneſſe and Holineſſe he teſtified by his obedience to his Will) and of making himſelfe happy by drawing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40146:136"/>from God All-ſufficient, ſupplies of good both inward and outward, temporal and eternal. I ſay, it cannot be doubted, but that Satans main endeavour was to take off and ſever mans heart from God, and cutting in ſunder thoſe two bands of faith and obedience by which he adhered unto God, to draw him away to infidelity and rebellion againſt his own Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>In ſubordination to this end, the devils firſt taske was to undermine, and overthrow the very foundations upon which faith and obedience are built, which are theſe two. Firſt, a perſwaſion of Gods All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and love to man, both of them manifeſted by experience, in a great part, and farther made up in his gracious and faithful Promiſes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the impreſſion of the feare and terrour of Gods wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, grounded upon the apprehenſion of his Holineſſe and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, teſtified ſufficiently by his threatenings againſt the tranſgreſſors of his Law: Therefore we ſhall finde, that in this temptation Satan lays his firſt battery againſt the perſwaſion of Gods goodneſſe and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to man, which he endeavours to diſcredit, and make man doubt of, by all the wayes and meanes he can.</p>
                  <p>The next attempt of Satan, is to take off from man the impreſſion of Gods feare, wrought upon his heart by the denunciation of that feareful curſe, threatened in caſe of the tranſgreſſion of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: To leſſen and take off the terrour whereof, Satan oppoſeth and contradicts the truth of that Word, on the faithfulneſſe whereof the terrour of that curſe depended, that ſo man might have no cauſe to cleave unto that God, that meant him no good, nor was likely to do him any harme.</p>
                  <p>To ſet man looſe from God was but one part of Satans aime, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though he might fall off from God in a diſcontented humour; yet upon better advice, experience might ſhew him, that it would be needful to cloſe with God again, therefore to make an utter and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual divorce between God and man, the devil makes uſe here of the ſame policy, that he put afterwards into <hi>Jeroboams</hi> head, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Kingdome of the ten tribes to himſelf and his poſterity, which was to keep them from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> according to Gods Ordinance, (which might in time unite them to the Kingdome of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> again) and for that end to ſet up two calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſo Satan in this place ſets before man other gods to cleave unto, that when he was once looſe from God, he might never entertain thoughts of returning to him again. For which cauſe he propoſeth unto him; Firſt, for his ſcope, the ſeeking of his own good, in ſtead of advancing Gods honour. Secondly, dependance upon the creature, as the means of procuring that good unto himſelfe, which he ſought after, inſtead of reſting and depending upon God alone, as the only fountain of all his happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the leſſening of Gods credit with man, (by which both the opinion of his goodneſſe, and the terrour of his wrath might be weakened) was ſo neceſſary for the compaſſing of Satans end, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40146:137"/>that were done, all his labour had been loſt, in endeavouring to take off mans heart from cleaving unto God: And becauſe the effects of Gods kindneſſe and love to man, were ſo evident that they could not be denied, therefore there was no way left to Satan, but to caſt jealouſies into mans minde of Gods intentions, in all that he had done for him: and becauſe there was no other way to hinder mans believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, which God had ſo expreſly and directly threatened, but flatly to contradict and deny that God meant what he ſpake, ſeeing the jealouſies of Gods intentions, both in his bleſſings beſtowed, and in his judgement threatened, (muſt needs have all their force from the credit of him that preſented them) we ſhall therefore finde, that Satan makes uſe of all his Art to win credit to himſelfe, in all his treaties with the woman, which if he could once effect, he ſaw an eaſie way to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the credit of God ſo far with man, that he ſhould make no great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt thenceforth, either of his bleſſings, or of the threatening of his judgements.</p>

                  <head>Of the meanes by which Satan endeavoured to move <hi>Eve,</hi> to question and doubt of Gods love and kindneſſe to man, manifeſted in ſo many real bleſſings beſtowed on him.</head>
                  <p>The firſt policy of Satan in this particular, was in making choice of that ſpecial bleſſing of Paradiſe, ſo lately beſtowed, as yielding unto him the faireſt colour of cavil againſt it. For againſt the Creation of man after Gods image, the forming of the woman, and beſtowing her on him for his help, and giving unto them both the Lordſhip over all the creatures, there could lie no colour of exception at all, becauſe there was in none of thoſe any reſervation or reſtraint laid upon man. Only in Paradiſe there was the fruit of one tree reſerved, from the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof man was reſtrained, this was a fit occaſion of raiſing a ground of jealouſie, what might be the cauſe of that reſtraint, and what God might intend thereby.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan diſcovers the depth of his policy, in managing this cavil, raiſed againſt God upon this occaſion to his beſt advantage. For, whereas it was ſo evident, that God had both planted Paradiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on man, and that the Garden was pleaſantly ſeated, and richly furniſhed with all variety of the choiceſt fruits, that none of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars could be denied; theſe things being ſo manifeſt in themſelves, the devil never queſtions, and yet when he could not deny ſo great a bleſſing, he labours to abaſe the worth and eſtimation of it in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he inſiſts upon the reſtraint, that God had beſtowed this gift with a limitation, whereas true bounty is moſt commended in this, that it is every way free and entire, this is an exception that carries with it ſome ſhow of truth, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, beyond this, Satan abaſeth this gift by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, pretending (moſt maliciouſly and falſely) that although God made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40146:137"/>ſhew of giving much, yet in true eſtimation, all that he had given was of ſmall value, in compariſon of that which he had withheld. For, when he perſwades the woman to eat of that fruit, although forbidden, for the ſingular vertue which it had to open the eyes, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply, that no other tree in the Garden had this vertue, but that a lone. Otherwiſe, the woman might have replied, that other fruits might have the ſame vertue, and conſequently, that ſhe had no reaſon to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard her ſelfe upon Gods diſpleaſure by breaking his Commandment, when ſhe might have the ſame benefit without any ſuch danger another way; ſo that we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that when Satan affirmes that this tree had that vertue, and that therefore ſhe muſt not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from eating of it, by Gods interdiction, that he implies, that this tree which they were forbidden to eat had a vertue, that no other tree in Paradiſe had beſides. And further, expreſſing what that vertue was, namely, that it would make one wiſe, and furniſh him with ſuch excellent knowledge, as would advance him near to the ſtate of a God, he doth in effect imply, that the reſt of the trees of the Garden, whereof God hath given man liberty to take, were but of vulgar and common uſe, little better then the food which he had allowed unto beaſts, fit to ſuſtain only the body, the baſer part of man, but this tree had a vertue, not only to ſuſtain, but to enrich and adorne the ſoul, the more excellent part of man, and that alſo in the moſt eminent faculty thereof, by which he excelled all other creatures, Wiſdome and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Other fruits might ſuſtein men in the condition in which now they were, but this would raiſe them above the condition of a man, and make them in a ſort matches with God himſelfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing this tree was of ſuch ineſtimable worth, and the reſt of the fruites only of vulgar and baſer uſe, Satan leaves it to the woman to inferre thereupon, that Gods ſeeming bounty to man was of little worth, if his gifts were compared with that which he might have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, if he had been ſo kinde to man, as he pretended and made ſhew to be. Now Satan in ſuppoſing this tree to have in it ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value, had this advantage, that in that which he affirmed, it was impoſſible for him to be diſproved, if he were not believed, ſeeing there had never been any experiment made of it hitherto, as indeed there could not be, without breach of Gods Commandment, which Satan laboured to draw man unto.</p>
                  <p>Satans third meanes, by which he labours to raiſe jealouſies againſt God in the womans minde, was in queſtioning his affection and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards the man and woman, which he inſinuates to <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe had juſt cauſe to doubt of, nay further, that ſhe had great reaſon to ſuſpect, that they were not ſincere and upright towards her, what ſhew ſoever was made to the contrary. Not only becauſe God had given her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things of no great worth, in true eſtimation, but had detained from her that which was of true worth indeed, whereas true love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts things of the greateſt and higheſt value; but beſides, in divers other reſpects.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40146:138"/>
                  <p> Firſt, that God had not only withheld that fruit from man for the preſent, but under a fearful penalty debarred him the uſe of it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; now it was not probable, that if the fruit of that tree had not been of greater worth then the reſt of the fruits of the Garden, that God would have threatened ſuch a fearful judgement for tranſgreſſing in a trifle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the vertue of this fruit was knowen unto God well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſeeing he had made it, and therefore muſt needes know what vertue himſelf had given it. Conſequently, it argued an ill affection and envious diſpoſition towards man, to withhold from him a fruit that might have been ſo beneficial unto him, wittingly, and therefore of ſet purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this envy in God of mans good and happineſſe, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſo much the more in this, that if God had allowed man the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that fruit, which he had interdicted, himſelf had loſt nothing by it; for although man had been advanced to an higher condition, yet God ſhould have held his place, and continued a God ſtill. Now for one to hinder anothers good, in that wherein himſelf ſhould ſuſtain no prejudice, muſt needes argue an evil and envious diſpoſition in that perſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Satan alledging that the fruit of this tree, and this only had power to open the eyes, and to make one wiſe, implies, that man being forbidden the uſe of it, was to be led on, and paſſe his dayes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gnorance and blindneſs, in a baſe condition unworthy of a man, who might (unleſſe Gods interdiction had hindred it) have been little leſſe then a God. In raiſing thoſe jealouſies in mans minde againſt God, grounded upon his ſecret intentions, Satan had great advantage, it being impoſſible that he ſhould be diſproved, (ſeeing intentions are ſecret, and not eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered) and therefore was not without hope to be believed.</p>

                  <head>Of the cunning inſinuations, by which Satan endeavours to winne credit and a good opinion of himſelf with the woman.</head>
                  <p>To breed in the womans minde a good opinion of himſelf, that theſe ſuggeſtions might make the deeper impreſſion upon her heart, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſo manageth his whole diſcourſe with her, that ſhe might conceive and be perſwaded, that all the advice which he gives her, proceeded meerly out of his love and good affection towards her and her husband, whereof he ſeems to give ſome taſte divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by tendring his advice freely and unrequeſted, which might ſeem to proceed out of more then an ordinary care and deſire of mans good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by expreſſing himſelf in ſuch termes in the firſt queſtion which he propoſeth that may ſeem to proceed from ſome kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation within at this reſtraint which God had laid upon man, as if he were much affected inwardly to ſee ſo excellent a creature kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and held in ignorance, as it were, in a kinde of bondage, and (to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40146:138"/>man) the worſt kinde of bondage, and detained in a mean and low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, being reſtrained from the only meanes that might advance him higher, and that meerly to ſatisfie Gods Will, who ſhould loſe nothing thereby.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſeemes to command his love to man by making ſhew of much forwardneſſe, by directing him to the beſt meanes, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his own happineſſe by raiſing himſelf unto an higher conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to become a match even unto God himſelfe. Thus in laying our baites we uſually make ſhew of providing for thoſe creatures, which we intend to enſnare and devoure. Nay, he makes ſhew of ſeeking mans good, even in that which God had denied him, ſo that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the woman to be a greater furtherer of mans happineſſe then God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, leſt the woman might doubt whether the Serpents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love were ſincere and hearty, to make it appear, that this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his was real and cordial, (as it concerned him to do, if he meant to have his Counſel followed, ſeeing no man uſually receives advice, or is perſwaded by any perſon, of whoſe ſincerity and true affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him he hath any cauſe to doubt) Satan firſt traduceth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for dealing unfaithfully with man, and beguiling him by a falſe ſhew of liberality, when in the mean time he withheld from him the only meanes which might make him truly happy, under a ſevere inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and threatening the penalty of death if he medled with it. Now commonly, either men are indeed, or at leaſt deſire to be thought free from thoſe evils, which they charge upon other men. Again, we do not manifeſt the ſincerity of our affection towards others, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more then in our careful endeavours to prevent other mens impoſtures, who ſeek to beguile others, by diſcovering unto them the ſnares that are laid for them, or injuries that are done unto them, which good office the devil comes to performe unto the woman in this place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to make yet the fairer ſhew of the ſincerity of his affection to man, the divel propoſeth ſuch a good unto the woman, as ſeemes meerly to have relation to her only, without any manner of reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, who gives the advice, for what advantage might the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man probably conceive that Satan might make unto himſelf, if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be as God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to approve his ſincerity yet the more in this particular, he chargeth God in effect with the contrary practice. For to ſay, that God interdicted to man the eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, becauſe it would make him as God, is in effect to ſay, that he withheld this tree from man for his own advantage, namely, that he might excel alone, and that none might ſhare with him in his honour. So then, if God manifeſted his inſincerity to man in denying and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding from him that which might do him moſt good, then doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan approve the ſincerity and uprightneſſe of his heart towards man, in ſhewing him the way to attain that happineſſe, without any reſpect at all to his own advantage.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40146:139"/>
                  <p> The third thing by which Satan labours to win credit to himſelfe, is, by endeavouring to gain the reputation of wiſdome, an ability abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to any perſon that takes upon him to give advice to another: the opinion whereof prevailes much with him that is advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to give eare unto the counſel that is given him. Now it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, if Satan made ſhew of wiſdome and much knowledge, if we conſider what a large meaſure of underſtanding is yet left in thoſe damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, even ſince their fall, though it be exceedingly empaired thereby. Now it could not but breed in the woman a great opinion of Satans wiſdome, and extraordinary knowledge, when ſhe heares him ſpeak of things altogether unknown to her, as namely of evil, of which ſhe had never heard before, but much more when he comes to ſet out that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vertue of the tree, and that ſtrange property which he affirmed it had to make one wiſe like a God: But above all this, when he ſeems to dive ſo ſubtlely and deeply into Gods ſecret counſels, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrangely his very thoughts and intentions, and to lay open all his ſecret drifts and policies, which <hi>Solomon</hi> affirmes to be a marke of a man of great wiſedome and prudence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.5.</p>

                  <head>Of Satans third practice, his endeavouring to take away from the woman the terrour of the Curſe threatened by God if ſhe brake his Commandment.</head>
                  <p>By abaſing and leſſening of the value of the gift which God had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon man, in planting for him, and beſtowing freely on him that Garden of delights, and thereby weakening the opinion that ſhe had conceived of Gods love, ſo largely expreſſed in that great gift, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtioned but Satan had well nigh looſed the ſtrongeſt band, by which her heart was knit unto God. There remained yet behinde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cord, which might withhold her from a total Apoſtaſie from him, namely, the terrour of that fearful curſe, which God had threatened to lay upon man, if he ſhould tranſgreſſe his Commandment, which the devil finding no meanes to looſe and untie, makes no more ado, but cuts it quite in ſunder. That God himſelf had denounced this curſe, was ſo evident, that it could not be denied, <hi>Eve</hi> herſelfe (as it is moſt probable) or at leaſt her husband had heard it from his own mouth of the ſenſe of the words there could be as little queſtion, they were ſo plainly and perſpicuouſly delivered, that they admitted no doubtful conſtruction. As impoſſible it was to queſtion Gods Power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and inflict that curſe which he had denounced: It muſt needs be granted, that he who had giuen life could much more eaſily take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at his pleaſure: wherefore there was no other way left unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but to affirme boldly, that God never intended to execute what he had threatened, but that he gave that terrible threatening only in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy for another end of his own. Now to make this ſeem the more probable to the woman, Satan layes before her theſe two grounds, which the woman might probably conceive to be manifeſt truths.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40146:139"/>
                  <p> Firſt, he confidently affirmes, that God very well knew that the fruit of that tree had no power to work any ſuch effect, as to kill thoſe that ſhould eate it. Nay, on the contrary, that he knew (as well he might, ſeeing he that made the tree could not be ignorant of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which he had given it) that this tree and the fruit thereof had a farre other operation, that in ſtead of killing and deſtroying, it had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vertue, to do good to ſuch as ſhould eate of it, yea, to bring them the greateſt good of which man was capable, even wiſdome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſuch as might make them matches to God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſuggeſts, that although God knew this, yet it was no marvel though he concealed it, and to that end threatened them with death, if they adventured to taſte of the fruit of that tree; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if man by eating thereof attained to ſuch a meaſure of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he would become in a ſort Gods equal, who ſhould thereby loſe that honour in which he ſo much gloried of excelling alone. Thus he tells <hi>Eve</hi> in effect, that God did but delude them with a feigned terrour, and that alſo meerly in policie, out of an ambitious deſire to preſerve his own glory of excelling alone, for which end it was that he kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his creatures, as it were, in a kinde of bondage and baſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two ſtrange aſſertions the devil layes down with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being ſuch as although they were not eaſie to be contradicted upon any manifeſt evidence, yet were impoſſible to be proved by any convincing argument. Wherefore (after his uſual cuſtome) putting on a bold face, he ſupports them meerly by his own confident Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affirming not only that it was true which he had informed, but that God himſelf knew it to be true, laying his own credit to pawne for the juſtifying of what he had ſpoken, and offering it to be tried by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that out of hand. One day, he tells the woman, would evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by proofe make good all that he had affirmed. By theſe weak ſuggeſtions, having no ground to ſupport them but only the credit of a liars word, Satan having now engaged the womans affections, eaſily removes from her heart the feare of Gods juſt indignation, which the apprehenſion of that terrible curſe, threatened by the Lord himſelf with his own mouth, had ſetled in her heart before.</p>

                  <p>That it concerned Satan, if he intended to hold on man in a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Apoſtaſie from God, to faſten him to a dependance upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he might have no cauſe to look back unto God any more, hath in part been intimated heretofore: That truth is founded upon this an unqueſtionable maxime, that no creature (nor conſequently man) hath ſufficiency in and of it ſelfe, and conſequently being naturally carried on by a conſtant deſire after its own good, cannot poſſibly be at reſt, till it meet with ſome meanes from which it may receive a ſupply
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40146:140"/>of that which it wants in it ſelfe. Man therefore being a reaſonable creature, (and conſequently, by the benefit of his underſtanding, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his inability to ſubſiſt of himſelfe) by a principle which God hath planted in nature, muſt of neceſſity put forth his deſires after ſomething out of himſelf to lean unto, from which he may have his wants ſupplied, and when he hath found it to adhere unto, and depend upon it. Now then Satan, having already perſwaded the woman that God did but delude her, and meant her no good, and therefore was not any further to be depended on, eſpecially for that good which ſhe now wanted, and which was moſt proper to her nature, the knowledge of good and evil, the meanes of attaining whereof he had interdicted her, under a fearful curſe. In the next place, takes upon him to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the woman another, and that a more eaſie and certain meanes of furniſhing her ſelfe with that which God held and kept from her, and thereby raiſing her ſelfe to a more excellent condition then that which God had beſtowed upon her. This (ſaith he) the fruit of that tree which you are forbidden to touch (as you ſay) will furniſh you withal.</p>
                  <p>Thus Satan deales with <hi>Eve,</hi> as ſubtile men uſe to do when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to break off a treaty of marriage; they ſet another match on foot rather: as thoſe that endeavour to draw away a mans heart from his own wife, they entangle him in the love of a ſtrange woman. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Satan well knew, that mans dependance upon God, neceſſarily drew on theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, an abſolute ſubjection to his Will in all things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the referring and carrying on of all things to his glory. Here again, Satan takes hold of another advantage. To be guided wholly by the Will of another, and to lay aſide his own will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and to refer all to the honour and glory of another, might ſeem to be an heavy yoke, &amp; ſuch as in all probability man would be very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhake off, if he might: wherefore Satan offers unto man to take his own will for his rule to guide himſelfe, and to make his own good the end and ſcope of all his actions. If this were hearkened unto, as it was very probable it would, then was mans Apoſtaſie from God unto the creature (as it is deſcribed to be) total and abſolute to himſelf (being a creature) as his own end, and to other creatures as the meanes on which he might depend to ſupply him in what he needed.</p>
                  <p>Satans firſt taske, namely, to take off mans heart from ſubjecting it ſelfe, and all the deſires thereof to the Will of God, and aiming at, and carrying on all his actions and endeavours to his glory (ſuppoſing his heart to be already fallen off from God, and any dependance on him) ſeemes to be an eaſie work. Indeed if the motion had been to propoſe unto him another Lord, it would have ſounded very harſhly. As good or better continue his ſervice under his old Maſter, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf and ſtoop to a new. But to be ſubject to no Lord at all, and to be every way abſolute of himſelf and free altogether, was an offer, not only faire and plauſible, but at the firſt view ſeemes to carry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40146:140"/>with it ſome ſhew of juſtice and equity. For ſuppoſing God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way, then was man the moſt eminent of all viſible creatures, and conſequently, fit to govern himſelf according to his own will, and to be the ſcope of his own endeavours in ſeeking his own good. Beſides, that natural ſelf-love which God had planted in all mens hearts, by which he is ſtirred up to uſe all meanes for the attaining to his own chiefeſt good, and is not only allowable, but a duty too, if it be done within due bounds and limitations taken from our ſubordination to God, and reſpect to community, when thoſe reſpects unto God were removed, muſt neceſſarily carry on man to a total and abſolute ſelf-ſeeking, without any limitation or further reſpect at all. Now that this was Satans policy, to move man to take it on him to be his owne Lord, appears evidently, partly by his advice to eat of that tree though it were forbidden, which was in effect to guide himſelfe by his own Appetite, and not by his Makers Will, and partly, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement upon which he endeavours to perſwade him to embrace that counſel, becauſe it would make him a God; as if his own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the main end to which he ſhould bend all his endeavours. And how eaſily he prevailed upon our firſt Parents by this policy, the lamentable event which immediately followed, ſufficiently diſcovered, the advice being embraced and aſſented unto as ſoon as it was tendered, and well nigh as ſoon put in execution as it was embraced.</p>
                  <p>Satan having prevailed upon our firſt Parents by this ſuggeſtion, had now gained what he deſired. For firſt, God was (as much as lay in the creature) put out of his Soveraignty over the chief work of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan himſelf in effect poſſeſſed that Soveraignty of which God was deprived. For we ſhall finde, that howſoever the devil ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto <hi>Adam</hi> the title of becoming his own lord, yet in effect it was himſelf that bore all the ſway, whoſe counſel and advice wholly ruled man from thence forward, who was now over-ruled by ſuch vile luſts, as Satan ſtirred up, and raiſed, and continually cheriſhed in his heart, as to this day, we know wicked men in giving up themſelves to their own luſts, are ſaid to walk after him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. to do his luſts or his will, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. and ſo to be carried, and held, and led captive by him at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</p>
                  <p>The devil then having prevailed upon man, ſo far as to renounce his obedience to God, and to ſet up his own will to be his rule to guide him; In the next place, (becauſe man had no ground to expect any good from that God whom he refuſed to ſerve) findes out, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto him another meanes of ſubſiſting and obtaining what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired without God, by the help of the creature; Aſſuring the woman that the fruit of that forbidden tree would furniſh her with as great a meaſure of wiſdome as ſhe could deſire, even ſufficient to make her a match to God himſelf, which was far greater then that which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given her by God. That forbidden fruit Satan pitcheth upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other baits, for divers reaſons.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40146:141"/>
                  <p> Firſt, it is moſt probable that <hi>Eve</hi> had taſted of divers of the fruits of the Garden, in which ſhe had found no extraordinary vertue, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were pleaſant to the taſte, and good for food. This fruit had never yet been taſted, and therefore might have in it ſuch a ſecret vertue as Satan had diſcovered to the woman, for ought ſhe knew to the contrary, having never tried it.</p>
                  <p>Again, that it was a fruit of more then ordinary worth it ſeemed very probable, becauſe it was ſo preciſely interdicted, and that under ſo fearful a curſe, which was no leſſe then death, yea, all kinds of death; now it might ſeem improbable that God would deſtroy man, the moſt excellent of all his creatures for a trifle, conſequently, that fruit might be preſumed to have ſome extraordinary worth in it, ſeeing the eating thereof deſerved ſo great a penalty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Satan might conceive, that the very interdiction of that fruit might quicken the womans deſire after it, if for no other reaſon, yet becauſe it was forbidden.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the fruit was at hand, and a fruit deſirable for the goodneſs for food, and pleaſantneſſe to the eye, and if the woman could once be brought to taſte of it, he was ſure enough that it muſt neceſſarily bring utter deſtruction on her ſelfe and her poſterity, which was all his aime.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>A conſideration of Satans great Art, and deep policy in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this temptation.</head>
                  <p>The firſt ſlight of Satan in this temptation, was in the choice of a fit opportunity to aſſault the woman to his beſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſets upon her before uſe and practice had confirmed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her heart in the feare and love of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he takes her alone (as it ſeems moſt probable) ſevered at that time from her husband, who otherwiſe by his counſel, might have adviſed her and ſtrengthened her againſt the temptation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in deferring the aſſault until the woman came within the view of the fruit forbidden, that by the meanes of that pleaſant out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward object, her affections might be moved being at hand, that ſo he might both ſtrengthen the temptation the more, and preſſe it on with greater violence, having the help of her outward ſenſes delighted with the view of ſuch an alluring object to blinde her eyes, and thereby pervert her judgement; and withal, that the fruit being ſo neare, that ſhe might preſently put forth her hand and take it, and ſo might in an inſtant be drawen to act what ſhe had conſented unto, that ſo there might be no place left for further deliberation, upon which many times men alter their reſolution.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond policy of Satan may be diſcovered, in his wary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this temptation, wherein he comes on by degrees to his intended purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, aſſaying the womans conſtancy by a queſtion of enquiry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40146:141"/>he ſpake any thing poſitively and affirmatively. And this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too he propoſeth, partly, by way of admiration, as wondering that God ſhould do ſuch a thing as to lay a reſtraint upon man in the midſt of his pleaſures in the place of his continual abode, conſidering that he had been ſo free unto him in all the reſt of his gifts, partly, by way of doubting: as if he had ſaid, Is it true indeed? Are you ſure of it: What, that it is God that hath ſaid ſo? What, concerning the Trees of the Garden, that you ſhall not eat of them being ordained for meat? Laſtly, by way of indignation, if it ſhould be ſo in this manner: Is it poſſible,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that God ſhould plant a Garden for you, and deny you to eat the fruits of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that God ſhould ſet them full in your eye, to vex you the more by beholding daily that which you may not taſte or meddle withal?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the fruit forbidden you be no better then other fruits, that God ſhould ſtick with you for trifles? If this fruit be of any rare vertue above the reſt, that he ſhould grant you the worſt, and deny you the beſt? Theſe ſeveral glaunces the devil may be conceived to caſt out in this general and captious queſtion, conveighing therein ſo many ſeveral baites to attempt the womans minde, that ſhe might taſte either the one or the other, and be enſnared on which ſoever ſhe faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
                  <p>A third dangerous ſlight of Satan, was the concealing of the ſcope and end at which he aimed, which was to draw man into rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, whereof at the firſt he gives not the leaſt intimation.</p>
                  <p>For in his firſt queſtion, he ſeemes only to enquire of the truth of the pretended interdiction, adviſing the woman to conſider whether ſhe were not miſtaken, at leaſt, in ſome circumſtance or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he ſaw the womans minde to be affected with ſome kinde of diſcontent againſt God, he foments it rather by ſecret inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which might reflect upon God at the ſecond hand, then by plain and direct calumniations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his advice he ſeemes not ſo much to diſſwade them from God, as to perſwade them to ſeek their own good, propoſing to them only the meanes of advancing their own eſtate, without touching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God any way in outward appearance. For mans advancement could not be conceived at the firſt view to be any detraction from God, who ſhould retain his own honour, though man ſhould come a ſtep nearer to him by attaining the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Satans fourth ſtrain of wit was in the choice of that baite, by which be drew the woman to the breach of Gods Commandment, namely, the hope of gaining knowledge, which <hi>the heart of the prudent getteth,</hi> Prov. 18.15. as well underſtanding, that <hi>it is not good that the heart be without knowledge,</hi> Prov. 19.2. ſo that a thing ſo agreeable to mans nature in the improving of that ability by which he excelled all other
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40146:142"/>creatures, and drawes neareſt unto God in, could not but move the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans affections exceedingly, eſpecially conſidering that great meaſure of knowledge which ſhe enjoyed in the ſtate of her innocency, which could not chuſe but quicken her with an earneſt deſire to encreaſe it further, as indeed it was her duty to endeavour to abound therein, or at leaſt to confirme that knowledge which ſhe had by uſe and experience. We may likewiſe conceive that our firſt Parents had ſome knowledge of that future eſtate, unto which they were to be advanced, when they ſhould no more behold God in the dim glaſſe of the creatures, as now they did, but ſhould ſee him face to face, and know him as they were known. All theſe conſiderations laid together might prevail much with the woman, to make uſe of the meanes propoſed by Satan to encreaſe her knowledge,</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, it was Satans ſpecial care to repreſent unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this meanes of gaining the knowledge of good and evil in the moſt alluring way that he could poſſibly deviſe. For whereas there are three things eſpecially that encourage men to the uſe and effectual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of any meanes that may further them to the attaining of a deſired end propoſed unto them;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that they are eaſily procured.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they are delight ſome in the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they are of great efficacy, and ſpeedy in operation: Of all theſe Satan makes ſhew in perſwading the woman to the eating of this forbidden fruit for the gaining of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, what could be more eaſie then to pluck from a tree that ſtood full in her way?</p>
                  <p>Next, what could be more delightful then to eat of a fruit ſo grateful to the taſte, and beautiful to the eye, as that fruit appeared to be to the woman, as we ſhall ſee anon?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there could be nothing more ſpeedy or effectual in operation then this fruit, which ſhould produce the deſired effect the ſame day that it was taken, as Satan makes the woman believe. All theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements the devil layes before her, and how he prevailes by them we ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>Satans ſixth policy in beguiling the woman, was in the choice of the kinde of the ſin to which he tempts her; which if it had appeared to be ſome ſin againſt the Law of Nature, ſuch are blaſphemy againſt God, lying &amp;c. Satan might have found it an hard taske, to carry her againſt the principles of nature, ſo firmely planted in her heart: wherefore he makes choice of ſuch a Law, as was no Law of Nature, but meerly poſitive, preſcribed only by Gods Will, to tempt her to the breach of that Law, which nothing but pure obedience to God will bound her to obſerve. As for the Act it ſelf,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was a matter of no value in which ſhe ſhould offend, being only the eating of the fruit of one of the Trees of the Garden. A conſideration which occaſions ſo much ſlighting of ſin in many profane hearts to this day.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40146:142"/>
                  <p> Secondly, the ſcope of the action ſeemed to be only mans good, without any wronging of God at all (who might be conceived to loſe nothing by mans gaine,) or the creature which was ordained to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was an offence unto which they were not carried by any rebellious inclination of their own hearts, but unto which they were directed, by the advice and counſel of one that pretended, and they were perſwaded was their friend, which alſo both the man and the woman alledge in their own defence afterwards, when God chargeth them with this ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if the devils ſuggeſtion had been true (that God knew that the fruit of that tree had ſuch a vertue that it would open their eyes) it might ſeem to them to be an action unto which God himſelf invited them, howſoever he had in expreſſe termes forbidden it. For why ſhould he give ſuch a vertue to that tree to make one wiſe to know good and evil, if it might not be uſed to that end? and by whom, if not by man, who was only capable of ſuch knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, in the choice of his arguments to move and perſwade the woman to eat of this forbidden fruit, Satan makes uſe of the depth of his cunning and policy, which we may eaſily diſcover in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in grounding all his arguments upon ſuch foundations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not manifeſt and apparent in themſelves, might the more ſafely be ſuppoſed, becauſe they could not by any clear evidence be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in producing arguments grounded upon ſome colour of truth, but thoſe groſly miſtaken and miſapplied.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in preſſing all arguments that might make for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his motion, and concealing all that might make againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then he urgeth two arguments grounded upon meer ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſuch things as being ſecret in themſelves, and not mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ted by any outward effect, were therefore impoſſible to be diſproved, which ſuppoſitions he alſo fortifies with ſuch faire probabilities, as might make them carry at leaſt ſome ſhew of truth.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, he ſuppoſeth that the fruit forbidden had a ſecret vertue, to make one wiſe, like a God, to know good and evil: who could diſprove this, ſeeing none had ever tried it? That it might hae ſuch a vertue</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the name given it by God himſelf, might ſeem to imply, for why was it called the tree of knowledge of good and evil, if it had not ſome vertue to give that knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the interdiction of the eating of that fruit, under ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a penalty ſeemes to imply as much, elſe why ſhould God forbid man the uſe of that fruit, when he granted him all the reſt of the fruits of the Garden, if there were not ſome vertue in this, that the other fruits had not? or, how could it ſtand with Gods juſtice to lay ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy a penalty for the eating of this fruit, if it were of vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe?</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40146:143"/>
                  <p> Laſtly, God may perhaps be conceived in policy to conceal the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this fruit from man, leſt he deſpiſing the interdiction, eating of the fruit forbidden, and thereby becoming wiſe as God, he might ſhare with him in his honour, and ſo God might loſe the glory of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling alone.</p>
                  <p>Satans ſecond argument of this kinde, is grounded upon the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition of Gods ſecret ill affection towards man, which if Satan ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who could diſprove it? for who could diſcover the ſecrets of his heart, which can be known to none but himſelf alone? That God was enviouſly affected towards man, there ſeemed to be theſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he had planted a Garden for man, and denied him ſome of the fruits of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that fruit which he had denied him, was only of true worth and value, and fit for an underſtanding creature, whereas that which <hi>God</hi> had given him was of little worth, only food for the body, which he had allowed to the very beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he implies that God muſt do this wittingly, ſeeing he that had made the tree, could not be ignorant of the vertue which himſelfe had given it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he ſuppoſeth, that God could have no other end in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting unto man the uſe of this fruit, but only to keep him under in a ſtate of vaſſalage, deſtitute of that knowledge of which he was capable, that himſelf might excel alone. With theſe plauſible ſuppoſitions the divel ſtrengthens his arguments to draw man on into rebellion againſt his Lord.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Satan grounds his argument upon ſuch things as carry with them ſome ſhew of truth, but thoſe he wreſts and miſapplies cunningly and deceitfully, to fit them to his own purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, he ſuggeſts, or at leaſt would have it ſuppoſed, that limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſtraints are a kinde of bondage. This poſition hath in it ſome truth, if it be duly limited in every reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in relation to the perſons. Reſtraints upon free men, that have juſt title to liberty are ſlaveries: but applied to men in reſpect of God, whoſe creatures they are, it is moſt falſe, for no creature can be free from ſubjection to him that made him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that poſition muſt be limited in reſpect of things from which we are reſtrained: reſtraints from neceſſary or profitable things impoſe a kinde of bondage; but reſtraints from hurtful or needleſſe things (ſuch as this tree was) are rather profitable directions, then any abridgement of lawful liberty.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is unreaſonable that man, who was created an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature, capable of knowledge, ſhould be kept in blindneſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: this hath ſome truth in it, if we confine it only to things fit to be known; but to be ignorant of unneceſſary things is an eaſe, to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of hurtful things is ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is lawful for any man to ſeek his own good: It is true,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40146:143"/>if we reſtrain it to a good proportion, able to ones ſtate and condition, (that is really good to him) and beſides, if it may be obtained by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meanes. But this good which Satan perſwades <hi>Eve</hi> to ſeek after, was neither fit for <hi>Adams</hi> preſent condition, nor to be obtained by any other meanes then by breaking of Gods Commandment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, one ought not to hinder anothers good for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (as Satan chargeth God to deal with man in this particular caſe,) is a true rule between the creature, who owes to another this duty of ſeeking one anothers good. But it is utterly falſe if it be applied to God, who having (as warrantably he might,) made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, might juſtly limit the good of all that he had made by due reſpects unto his own glory.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is not lawful to ſeek to excel alone: it is true, applied to the creature; but extended unto God, is falſe and prodigiouſly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; who if he ſhould ceaſe to excel alone, muſt ceaſe to be a God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Satans laſt ſlight in urging his arguments, is, in producing all that might move the woman to embrace his motion, and concealing all that might make againſt it. For if the loving kindeneſſe of God to man, manifeſted among all the creatures, in forming only man after his own Image and likeneſſe, ſo as he had done no other viſible creature, in making him lord over all the reſt of his creatures, which he put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, in giving him poſſeſſion of the whole world, in planting this Garden of delights meerly for his ſake, and beſtowing freely upon him all the fruits thereof to make uſe of at his pleaſure, reſerving only that one tree, and after all this to make mans happineſſe compleat eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, in creating ſuch a neceſſary and comfortable help as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, and beſtowing her upon him: All theſe, and the reſt of Gods favours, ſo lately and freely conferred upon man without any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, meerly out of Gods infinite and unconceivable goodneſſe, had been either remembred by Satan, or conſidered by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Eightly, Satans notable cunning and ſubtilty appeares yet further, in working upon, and ſtirring up the womans affections within, which he doth, partly, by putting her into a paſſion of diſcontent, which muſt of neceſſity caſt a miſt before the underſtanding, and blinde the eye of reaſon, and thereby diſable it to judge of things aright: And partly, by ſetting her at gaze upon that pleaſant viſible object of the forbidden fruit, which working upon the outward ſenſes, might awaken the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions within, and by both thoſe meanes might raiſe them up to ſuch a violent diſtemper, that reaſon ſhould be able to rule them no longer, but the affections now holding the raines, might carry the woman whither they liſt. Thus the divel wholly perverts that natural courſe, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40146:144"/>God in the beginning had ſet in the ſoule of man, according to which the faculties thereof exerciſed all their operations in the ſtate of mans innocency, which was, that the underſtanding being firſt duly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould give a rule to the Will and affections, upon adviſed delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and judgement: which order, if the woman had obſerved at this time, and referred the motion of Satan to the free and unpartial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the minde, queſtionleſſe Satan had loſt all his labour, and the falſhood and fraud of his ſuggeſtions had been diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>But above all the reſt of Satans policies, there is none matchable to the laſt, in preſſing the woman to a ſpeedy reſolution, without farther deliberation, and to the ſpeedy execution and putting in practice that counſel which he had given her, which is the neareſt way to thruſt in men headlong into miſchief. Now that the woman took no time for advice, appears by the Narration in the Hiſtory penned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein it is manifeſt that ſuppoſed vertue of this forbidden fruit is no ſooner diſcovered, but the fruit it ſelfe preſented to her view, is both deſired &amp; eaten before ſhe departs from the place, to bring her husband tidings of this new diſcovery of the means of their further happineſſe. That it was Satans policy to preſſe the woman to a ſpeedy reſolution and execution of what ſhe reſolved on, no man can doubt, who knowes and conſiders his ſubtile policy and induſtry in contriving and acting miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: And ſhall withal obſerve, how much a ſudden reſolution muſt needes further his deſign, the ſucceſſe whereof nothing could aſſure but a ſudden ſurpriſe. But beſides, in that he informes and perſwades the woman, that man ſhould become a God that very day that he taſted of the forbidden fruit, he intimates what he aimed at, which could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to involve the woman in this act of rebellion ſpeedily, that ſhe might as ſpeedily become a God, ſeeing we know that hopes of ſpeedy ſucceſſe are the moſt forcible motives to draw men to ſpeedy undertakings.</p>

In like manner, the devil makes ſhew by a leud woman to fill men with pleaſures, by ſatisfying them with fleſhly luſts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.18, 19. when in the mean time he leads them as an Oxe to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till a dart ſtrike through their liver, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. Thus he dealt with our Saviour, in tendering him all the Kingdomes of the world, but under a condition to fall down and worſhip him, and thereby to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as a God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9. The reaſon,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Satan hath no other prevailing way to beguile, but by making ſhew of ſeeking our good; which men by an inſtinct, planted in their nature by God himſelf, are ſo ſtrongly carried after, that they eaſily embrace any meanes which they conceive leades thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By this meanes Satan endeavours at leaſt to ſhare with God in the honour of his loving kindneſſe to man, an honour, as due unto him alone, ſo purchaſed unto himſelfe by the deareſt and greateſt price, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the blood of his own Sonne. This honour (one of the chiefeſt flowers of his Crown) the devil labours to rob him of in a great part, by pretending to ſeek mans good and happineſſe, as much, nay, much more then God himſelfe, as he deales with <hi>Eve</hi> in this place.</p>
                     <p>Let no man be ſo ſimple as to believe every word with the foole,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40146:150"/>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. But examine carefully and ſeriouſly, thoſe pleaſing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers tendered unto us by Satan or his Agents, of wealth, honour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, &amp;c. And therein conſider</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the perſon or inſtrument by whom the tender is made, or the advice given: if it proceed from wicked men whom we know to be guided by Satan, how can we expect that thoſe which hate and abhorre us, (as all wicked do ſuch as are godly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.) ſhould adviſe us to, or really intend unto us any thing for our good? Beſides, how ſhould we hope to receive good from thoſe, that ſeek no true good for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us ſeriouſly conſider, whether thoſe things that they propoſe unto us be really good or no; Honours, Wealth, Pleaſure (we know) more often burthen and enſnare the ſoule, then eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſure they never make the heart better, leave us ſometimes in the midſt, alwayes at the end of our dayes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, obſerve under what condition they tender theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, wherewith they allure us, whether we be not tempted to ſeeke them in ſome ſinful way. As wealth by robbery, or ſome other courſe of injuſtice, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. to fill our ſelves with pleaſures by defiling our own bodies, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.18. by which meanes we make an ill bargain, by winning the world and the pleaſures of ſin, with the loſſe of our own ſoules. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, conſider well, whether the offers be only verbal or real. Satan offered our Saviour all the Kingdomes of the world, whereof he had not one to beſtow. He offers <hi>Eve</hi> here increaſe of wiſdome and knowledge, which might advance her to the honour of a God, but ſhe findes nothing at laſt, in the event, but ignorance and ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, conſider whether the good tendred unto us be truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, or only in ſhew and outward appearance, whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward, temporary or eternal, ſuch as honour a man in the ſight of God, or only in the opinion of the world; for ſuch indeed are Honours, Riches, Pleaſures, only ſhadowes of good, deceiving the hearts of all thoſe that relie on them, and leaving them fooles at the latter end, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11.</p>
                     <p>But it is worthy our obſervation, that Satan in this great ſhew of love, that he makes unto man, dares not diſcover at firſt any ill intention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, wherein he uſeth great policy,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he might not be ſuſpected to tender this offer unto man, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of envy and hatred againſt God, then out of any true deſire of mans good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Leſt man, having his heart at preſent wholly filled with the love of God, the largeneſſe of whoſe bounty towards him had been manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo many late experiments, might have deteſted any motion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the leaſt injury to God to whom he was ſo deeply engaged. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe grounds Satan at firſt contents himſelf only with caſting out, by way of inſinuation, ſome ſecret grounds of diſcontent, and that too by way of queſtion and enquiry, till he might ſee how thoſe would be

                     <p>Withal we muſt take notice, that Satans warineſſe hinders not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual

                     <p>But we cannot but with admiration take ſpecial notice of Satans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, who preſumes to give God the lie, and flatly to contradict ſo evident a truth, ſo lately and expreſſely delivered from his owne mouth, and that alſo, as it is moſt probable in the womans own hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     <p>The end at which Satan aimed, in contradicting this intermination of death to be inflicted upon man, if he ſhould preſume to eate of the forbidden fruit, was to embolden the woman to rebellion, by freeing her from the terrour of Gods wrath, which might be a meanes, by the feare of the danger, to withhold her from committing the ſinne.

                     <p>That which we are to take notice of in the next place is, that Satan in ſpeaking of this intermination, takes up the phraſe it ſelfe in which God had delivered it, <hi>Gen</hi> 2.17. which the woman in her anſwer had altered, and expreſſed it in more gentle and uncertain termes, which queſtionleſſe he did, not to help the womans memory, nor much leſſe to taxe her for faultering in her anſwer: But rather, that when he had laid the curſe before her in the ſtricteſt termes, he might elude it, in a way of ſcorne, telling the woman in effect, that this terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was no other then a meer ſcar-crow, whereas God knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that no ſuch effect would follow, as he had threatened.

                     <p n="1">1. That whatſoever we enjoy, is more then we have any title unto by nature, who came into the world naked, a conſideration which <hi>Job</hi> quiets his heart withal, when he was at once ſtripped of all that he had, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. That God who hath allotted us our eſtates, is infinitely wiſe, and therefore better knows what is fitteſt for us then we our ſelves, and no leſſe kinde and loving, nay, much more then we are to our ſelves, and therefore will not faile to give us any thing that may be truly good unto us, as having given us his own Son, with whom he cannot but give us all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the life of man conſiſts not in abundance, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. but in a ſecret ſupply of our wants by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, who makes a little that a righteous man hath, better then the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the ungodly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That when we have what we would deſire, yet we muſt depend upon God for our allowance out of it every day, as all men rich and poor are directed to do by our Saviour, to beg of him their portion for every day.</p>
                     <p>Now this contentedneſſe muſt reach even to our ſpiritual as well as to our temporal eſtate; wherin our want of grace, ſenſe of our inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, continual conflicts with Satan, and foiles by him many times, though they may and ought to quicken us to prayer and watchfulnels, and make us humble and vile in our own eyes, yet ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet our hearts ſo far, as to provoke us to impatiency and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at our preſent condition, or to kindle our deſires to long after ſuch a change of it, as is not warranted. Rather our unquietneſſe at our own corruptions, ſhould beget in us only an holy indignation againſt our ſelves, for our errours and failings, with a deſire of that future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

                     <p>When Satan tells the woman, that by eating the forbidden fruit her eyes ſhould be opened, he neceſſarily implies, that for the preſent, both ſhe and her husband were blinde in effect; ſo that theſe are the two grounds upon which he endeavours to move the woman to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at her preſent condition.</p>

                     <p>Satan contents not himſelf with working the heart of the woman to a diſcontented humour againſt her preſent condition, but gives a ſtep farther and perſwades her that God knew how to help it, but would not, that by this meanes ſhe might conceive, that Gods heart ſtood not well affected towards her, and that he wiſhed her no good, whatſoever ſhew he made to the contrary.</p>

                     <p>When Satan perſwades the woman to eate of this fruit, though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and that under ſo heavy a curſe, he muſt withal neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that no other tree in the Garden, but that alone, had this vertue to make one wiſe, and that therefore they ſhould not feare to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the eating of it (although it were forbidden) for ſo great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For if any other tree, whereof they might freely eate, had the ſame vertue, it had been a vain thing to perſwade her to run ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an hazard, to gain that by eating the fruit forbidden, which they might as eaſily obtain without any danger at all, by eating of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit, which was not forbidden.

The reaſon is, that true liberality is the fruit of love, which is grounded upon the eſtimation of that which we love, and expreſſed in beſtowing upon the perſon whom we love, gifts anſwerable to the price and value that we ſet upon him. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> in diſpoſing of his eſtate, gave ſome portions to the ſons of his Concubines, but the choice and maine of his eſtate he left unto his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was his darling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6.

                     <p>Let us, upon this ground, admire the infinite and incomprehenſible love of God unto man, upon whom he hath beſtowed his own belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne, his choiceſt Jewel, his Delight daily, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. and that from all eternity.

The conſideration of this wonderful expreſſion of Gods love to man, as it cannot but amaze and aſtoniſh us, ſo it ought to quicken us to a ſerious enquiry, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that wonderful myſtery, that we may in ſome meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all Saints, that love that paſſeth knowledge, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meaſure it out in all the dimenſions thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19. that our mouthes may be filled with his praiſes, and our hearts with his love, conſidering what we may render unto him again, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.12. and reſolving to ſtick at nothing, wherein we may teſtifie our thankfulneſſe for ſuch manifeſtations of his love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the firſt of our increaſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3 9. the male of our flock, the flower of our age, the beginning of our ſtrength, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1. all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, even the ſtrongeſt affections of our ſouls, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of them</p>

                     <p>Satans endeavour in the firſt place (as we have ſeen) was to take off mans heart from God; his next policy is to faſter it to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

The reaſon whereof is, that there is by God himſelfe planted in the hearts of all men, the love of themſelves, which in ſubordination to God is warrantable, but the affection it ſelfe being natural, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrongly, is hardly, by the power of grace, which is but weake, kept within due bounds, that is, in ſubordination to God, and in a due reſpect to community.</p>
                     <p>Again, upon the ſame ground, when this inordinate ſelf hath once ſeized on a mans heart, it is hardly maſtered, as being grounded upon ſelf-conceit, or an high opinion of ones ſelfe, which eaſily prevails up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will, by which he makes choice of all things in relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo that both the affection, and all the endeavours are carried on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,

But moſt of all to our ſelves, who neglecting both our duty to him, when we reſpect our ſelves more then his honour, and towards our brethren, muſt therefore loſe all our reward, which is promiſed only to ſuch as ſerve God according to his will, and one another thorough love.</p>
                     <p>Let every man then, both abhor in his heart, and bend himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo dangerous an evil, the daughter of infidelity, mother of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, ambition, contention, and a thouſand like evils, and therefore by the juſt judgement of God, accompanied with theſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plagues.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The ſubjecting and abaſing of our ſelves to the creatures, for the attaining of our ends, whereas God hath put them under our feet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The troubling and vexing of our mindes with continual unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, cauſed neceſſarily, by ſeeking and labouring for that, unto which we can never attaine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The tempting of us to divers wayes of diſhoneſt gaine, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, envyings, uncharitableneſſe for the attaining of our deſired ends, ſeeing the wayes of Juſtice, Mercy and Truth can no way help us to gain that which we aime at. There is indeed Self conſidered in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God and community, which one may love, (otherwiſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would never have laid our love to our ſelves before us, as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of love to our neighbours,) namely, one may love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As Gods creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As created after his Image.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. As a ſervant to community, for the good of others: ſo farre one may not only love himſelf, but ſeek himſelf too upon theſe grounds, and in relation to theſe ends. But ſelfe taken without relation to God and community, is a meer phantaſie, to be abhorred as an idol of our owne braines. This ſelf-love is founded upon pride and ſelf conceit, or an opinion (though groundleſſe) of ones owne worth, whether for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Goodneſſe, or any inward or outward eminencie; And is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in leaning to ones own will and wiſdome, ſetting out his owne worth, rejoycing in himſelfe and his own good, in directing all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to the attaining of his own ends, and in his zeal againſt all that oppoſe him in that courſe. Therfore this foule evil muſt be oppoſed by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40146:167"/>ſelf-denial, (as incompatible with true Piety, which it quencheth where it reignes, and blemiſheth where it dwells) conſiſting</p>

                     <p n="3">3. In rejoycing in God alone, looking only at him as the fountain of whatſoever we are or have.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In bending all our endeavours to advance his glory, and to ſerve one another through love, as we are commanded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Gal</hi> 5.13.</p>
                     <p>To have moved the woman to ſeek after ſome baſe and ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure, or to have tempted her with profit (eſpecially being lord of the whole earth,) had been a vain thing, thoſe baſe earthly things her heavenly minde had never ſtooped unto: wherefore Satan findes out for her, and preſents unto her a baite fit for her, as being agreeable to her temper, the encreaſe of her knowledge, which might equal her even with God himſelfe, thus we uſually take fowles and fiſhes, by ſuch baites, as they naturally moſt delight in.

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we have here pointed out unto us the ſeveral ſteps and degrees, by which the woman went on, till ſhe came up to the height of her ſinne; ſhe ſaw, ſhe deſired, ſhe took and eat, and at the laſt gave unto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that he might eate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And gave alſo to her husband]</hi> Having queſtionleſs found the fruit as grateful to her taſte as ſhe expected, but not as Satan, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beguile him, but out of love to make him partaker with her, of this new-found meanes of her happineſſe. Thus Satan blinded her eyes, and God left her to her ſelfe, to be inſenſible of the evil which ſhe had brought upon her ſelfe, till ſhe had been led on by Satan to do as much miſchief as ſhe might, and drawen her husband into the ſame condition with her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With her]</hi> That is, to eate with her, or as ſhe had done: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt needs be with her, in the ſame place, when ſhe gave him of the fruit to eat. Now whether ſhe went after him to finde him out, or whether he came to her of himſelf, and when, and whether before ſhe had eaten of the fruit, or after (which is moſt probable) it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and not much material to be known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he did eate]</hi> By his wives perſwaſion, as well as by her offer of the fruit, and by her example for <hi>ver.</hi> 17. God cenſures him for heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the voice of his wife. By what words or arguments ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him it is not expreſſed, it is moſt probable, that ſhe related unto him all that which ſhe had heard from Satan before, which the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40146:172"/>Holy Ghoſt thinks not needful to repeat again, as affecting brevity, and having this only ſcope, to manifeſt, that God had no finger in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſinne, but that the woman was tempted and deceived by Satan, and the man by the woman. Thus were the two fountaines, out of which all mankinde iſſued, both poiſoned and corrupted, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of neceſſity, by them, their whole poſterity after them; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can be nothing clean, drawn out of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
                  <p>We have then in this verſe ſet before our eyes the ſucceſs and effect of Satans temptation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the womans affections are diſtempered and corrupted by her outward ſenſes; and both by them and by Satans ſuggeſtions, her Minde and Judgement are perverted, till ſhe breaks out at laſt into the actual tranſgreſſion of Gods Commandment, and drawes her husband after her.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is probable that the woman might have ſeen this tree before, without any inordinate affection towards the fruit thereof: it may be that it was not then ſo pleaſant in her eyes, as it now appeares unto her, after Satan had by his ſuggeſtions diſtempered her heart, and kindled her affections to an inordinate deſire after it, and then it ſeems very beautiful in her eyes.

This firme adherence of the heart of man to that which is good (from which it cannot be drawen, unleſſe it be by miſtaking, without the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nature it ſelfe) God hath planted in all mens hearts, not only that it might be a meanes of their own preſervation, which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bend unto, ſome by a natural, others by a ſenſitive, and Man by a rational inclination, but beſides, for an higher end; that Man choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God above all things to depend on, and his will to ſubmit unto, and to place all his happineſſe in him, might thereby give a clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſet to his ſeale, that he eſteems God as the chiefeſt good, becauſe his heart which carries him on with a reſtleſſe deſire to ſeek that above all things, and deſires no more when they do enjoy him with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. and 116.7.</p>
                     <p>Hence then appears, not only the folly of men of this world, who ſo greedily ſeek after Wealth, Honours, Pleaſures, and the favour of men, as if all their happineſſe lay in them; but more, their ſacrilegious impiety in robbing God of his due honour, to beſtow it not only on the creature, whom they advance above the Creator, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. when they ſeek their chief good in that rather then in him; beſides on our own baſe luſts, by which we guide our ſelves, rather then by the Will of God, as if there were more good to be found in them then in God Himſelf: ſo that the A poſtle juſtly cenſures them, <hi>to be lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4 which muſt needs be acknowledged to be true, when we ſeek after them more earneſtly and conſtantly, and rejoyce and ſatisfie our ſelves with them more cordially and contentedly then we do with the favour and love of God: this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away from God the chiefeſt flower of his Crown (which is to be good alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17.) to adorne with it the baſeſt creatures, is an

                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is the corruption, and froward perverſeneſſe of our wills, moved by our natural luſts, which encline to evil rather then good, to darkneſſe rather then light, and conſequently both to think well of them, and to make after and embrace them.</p>
                     <p>Let no man then lean to his own wiſdom, in a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as is the choice of his own happineſs, which even heathen men themſelves have diſcovered by their own experience, to be inſufficient for the chuſing of that which is truly good, as it muſt needs be, <hi>ſeeing it is

Whence it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us advice, that if ſinners tempt us, we ſhould not conſent unto them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. and then we ſhall do well enough. Whence alſo it is, that our Saviour, in his combate with Satan, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conſent to Satans motions, remained holy and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. The reaſonis;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the very eſſence of ſin conſiſts in the conſent. For all that Satan or his inſtruments act in temptations, is without the ſoule, whether it be by the repreſentation of objects to the outward ſenſes, or at the moſt to the inward fantaſie; for neither of theſe corrupt either the judgement, or will, or affections, there muſt be ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which muſt receive and cloſe with that which is repreſented unto it, before it can be a ſinne. For where the heart conſents not at all, (as it falls out in ſuch actions as are either altogether forced, or meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40146:179"/>wherein neither the judgement, nor will, nor affections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre) there men are wholly freed from any blame of ſin, both by God and man. Nay, even when the affections are either ſuddenly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, without deliberation, or violently carried (with ſome reluctation of the will) inordinately to any ſinne, yet where the precedent reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are againſt it, and ſubſequent repentance diſavowes it, and by conſequent both the one and the other manifeſt, that our adviſed judgement and will oppoſed it, there the ſin is not imputed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, nor accounted the ſin of the perſon, but rather of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the perſon, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. that the acts were not his but the acts of the ſin that dwelt in him. Whence St. <hi>John</hi> affirmes, <hi>that he that is born of God, ſinneth not,</hi> and addes this reaſon, <hi>that the ſeede of God abides in him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. that is, it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his ſin, becauſe his heart as far as it is renewed, conſents not to it. So it is not the repreſentation of evil motions outwardly, but only the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them with the heart that makes the ſinne, and only the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deliberate entertaining thereof that makes the damning ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if it were otherwiſe no man could be free from ſinne a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Satan would have power to draw men into all kindes of ſin, at his pleaſure, and thereby into inevitable deſtruction at the laſt, yea, even the deareſt of Gods ſervants.</p>
                     <p>Let no man, when he ſins, blame any but his own corrupt heart, as the Apoſtle adviſeth us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4, 5. looking at nothing but the ſin which was bred in him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his firſt conception, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22. he blames nothing but his own ignorance and bruitiſhneſſe for the diſtempered thoughts that troubled, and were likely to have perverted him. This is the way</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To juſtifie God in the executing of his juſtice againſt ſinners, when they therein receive only the fruit of their own wayes, and are filled with their own inventions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.31.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is the beſt meanes of furthering both our repentance and reformation, when we know every man the plague of his own heart, as <hi>Solomon</hi> termes it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.38. and finding the fountain of evil to be in our own breaſt, are more eaſily directed, and effectually ſtirred up to endeavour the mortifying of our own corruptions. The woman had no ſooner taſted this forbidden fruit, but finding it (as it is moſt probable) as good in the trial, as ſhe had read of it, as ſhe believed it to be by the outward ſhew, ſhe preſently tenders it to her husband, and draws him to be Partaker with her in the ſinne.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40146:181"/>right ordering of them to the end for which they were created, were now uncomely by their inordinate diſpoſition to ſin, as the affections of the ſoule within were likewiſe become filthy and ſhameful, by the like inordinate inclination of them to evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſewed fig-leaves]</hi> Whether becauſe they were neareſt at hand, or by reaſon of their largeneſſe fitteſt for that uſe, it is not eaſie to gueſſe. Only the making uſe of theſe leaves to cover their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, gives us no ſufficient ground to conclude, that therefore the tree, the fruit whereof they had eaten againſt Gods interdiction, was a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree. For if it had been ſo now when their eyes were opened, that they ſaw both their miſery and the cauſe of it, they would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have abhorred the tree, by which they had ſinned, above all others, and conſequently have made choice of any other thing for the covering of their bodies, rather then of the leaves of that tree.

                     <hi>And made them aprons]</hi> Or coverings to tie about their loines, for the covering of their ſecret parts. But why thoſe alone, ſeeing all the body was deformed, eſpecially the Eares, Eyes, Mouth and Hands, as being really defiled by the contagion of ſin, whereof they were ſpecial inſtruments? it is moſt likely, becauſe the beholding of thoſe parts more eaſily ſuggeſts unto our minds motions to uncleanneſſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though withal we may conceive, that becauſe ſin, the cauſe of ſhame is more eſpecially propagated by thoſe parts, (as <hi>David</hi> implies in that expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7.) it pleaſed God to make a deeper impreſſion of ſhame, which ſin brings with it upon thoſe parts then upon any of the reſt.</p>

Nay, many things appertaining to food it ſelf, which if we lay together we ſhall eaſily diſcover, that beſides all the reſt, the neceſſary proviſions of food in the uſe of fruits, and herbes, without dreſſing or cookery, were nothing near the truth of theſe various ſupplies, that the weakneſſe of nature, brought upon us by ſin, now neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to ſupport and uphold it.</p>

Howſoever it was framed, or whatſoever it was, it was ſuch as not only came from God ſupernaturally, but ſuch as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and his wife knew to come from God, as appears by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walking]</hi> It may be conſtrued, either God walking, or the voice walking. If we underſtand it of Gods walking, we muſt conceive God appearing in ſome bodily ſhape (as indeed many think that God, or rather Chriſt appeared unto <hi>Adam</hi> in a bodily ſhape, when he gave him his Lawes and brought him his Wife, but without any warrant out of Scripture, or neceſſity of any enforcing reaſon) ſeeing he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a bodily motion: or elſe, we muſt imagine that <hi>Adam</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the voice, was by God made to hear a ſound, as of one walking: but if we joyne walking with voice, and ſo reade it, <hi>The voice walking;</hi> it is a figurative ſpeech, expreſſing the coming on of the voice,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40146:187"/>or drawing and ſounding louder in <hi>Adams</hi> eares, as if it, or the perſon from whom the voice came did draw nearer, as the voice of the Trumpet <hi>Went on,</hi> (as it is in the Original) that is, encreaſed or waxed louder, (as we render it according to the ſenſe) <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.19. as if God went forwards, and drew nearer towards the people that ſounded the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. If we conſtrue this phraſe of the voices walking in this manner, then queſtionleſſe, the Holy Ghoſt by the voice cannot underſtand the inward voice of the conſcience, (although it cannot be doubted but they heard that voice too, and that very loud in their eares,) which could not but very improperly be ſaid to walk or come on, but rather ſome audible voice, ſounding outwardly in the eare, in what manner, or by what meanes framed, is not expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the winde of the day]</hi> Some by the winde of the day underſtand the afternoon, when they ſuppoſe that in the Garden, being ſeated in a hot countrey, there blew ſome freſh gale of winde to coole the heate of the aire, and they conceive mans fall and expulſion out of Paradiſe, to have been either without any, or with little intermiſſion between them. Others are of opinion, that there paſſed one night over our firſt Parents in their ſin, and that Gods appearance was the next morning, (when uſually in thoſe hot countreys there blowes ſuch a winde as is here mentioned) ſuppoſing that God gave unto the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors purpoſely this pauſe, between the ſin and the judgement, which paſſed upon them for it, to try whether they would recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſider what they had done. And after their hearts had been affected with the paſſing over of a troubleſom and uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able night (which uſually preſents unto us more ſad and ſerious thoughts) took the opportunity to treat with them the next morning. To gueſſe preciſely at the time when theſe things were done, is neither eaſie nor neceſſary, ſeeing the Spirit of God paſſed it over in ſilence: queſtionleſſe the judgement was not long behinde the ſinne. And there muſt neceſſarily be allowed ſome reaſonable ſpace between the one and the other, wherein the Delinquents after conference what to do, and reſolution taken to make them coverings for their bodies, might put in execution what they had reſolved upon, all which could not be done in a moment. Withal, it ſeems probable, that although God ſuffered them not to reſt long quiet in their ſinne, yet that he gave them ſome time to ſee what they would do, and finding their thoughts about their own condition, and the providing of a remedy for it to vaniſh into ſmoke, their eyes being fixed wholly upon the fruitleſſe conſideration of their outward miſery, without taking notice of the ſin which brought it on them, or the pollution of their ſoules thereby far more ſhameful then that which they obſerved in their bodies, he calls them to account, and points out unto them their ſinne of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and miſery that came upon them thereby, both in the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgement thereupon. That it might appear that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was Gods only work (being they were far from it, till God awakened and touched their hearts,) as well as the Promiſe of life was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40146:187"/>meerly from his free grace, the one wrought in them, and the other beſtowed on them, without their deſire, and much more without their deſert, as appears by the enſuing Narration. If place might be given to conjectures, we might probably gueſſe, that the Creation being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſixth day, the Law was given on the ſeventh, in which alſo the woman (as the duty of that day required) ſurveighing the fruits of the Garden was ſeduced by Satan and fell: and that this judgement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon her and her husband the eighth day, or firſt of the ſecond week, when alſo Chriſt was promiſed, and his Conqueſt over Satan which was perfected by his Reſurrection from the dead, which was upon the eighth day, or firſt day of the week. But theſe are only conjectures.</p>

                     <hi>And Adam and his wife hid themſelves]</hi> Finding their fig-leaves too ſleight a covering to hide them from Gods all-ſeeing eye, they betake themſelves to another refuge, ſhifting out of the way, (as they fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine) that they might not give an account for that which they could not juſtifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the face of Jehovah]</hi> From him whoſe preſence they rejoyced and took ſo much comfort in before, the ſame God becomes now a terrour to them.

But alas, how could thoſe trees hide them from the Preſence, even of men? much leſſe could they hide them from the face of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Behold now the fulfilling of Satans promiſe, and ſo the wiſdom that they had gotten by following his counſel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And I was afraid]</hi> The feare of reverence had not been blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but commendable, but that would not have driven him to his beeles; and yet this is the feare he ſeemes to alledge in his defence,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40146:197"/>when he addes in the next clauſe, that his nakedneſſe made him feare, when he heard Gods voice. But yet he anſwers not the queſtion fully, alledging that the hearing of Gods voice made him to feare and flie, but why the voice of God, which he heard without feare before, made him feare now (which was the chief thing enquired after) he gives no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe I was naked]</hi> Which was not altogether true, for he had ſome covering (though it were but of fig-leaves) to hide his nakedneſſe. In the mean time he ſeems to juſtifie himſelf, when he pretends, that it was only modeſty, and not the conſcience of any evil, or feare of puniſhment, that made him to hide out of the way. Nay, further then that, he implies at leaſt, that if there were any thing blame-worthy in his flight, the fault was Gods, who had made him naked, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unfit to be looked upon, and not his. So that in this anſwer he layes the blame upon God, though covertly, which in his next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he doth plainly and in expreſſe termes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I hid my ſelfe]</hi> Why, had not God made him naked, and was he now aſhamed to look upon his own workmanſhip? Again, was he not naked before, when God put him into the poſſeſſion of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and when he brought all the creatures before him, that he might give them names, and when he took a rib out of his ſide, and framed the woman of it, and brought her to him. Why was he now more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his nakedneſſe then he was then? But <hi>Adams</hi> excuſes will not abide the truth. Something he ſayes, but his anſwers like his fig-leaves are no fit covering, neither the one for the nakedneſſe of his body, nor the other for his ſin.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Adams</hi> firſt anſwer upon his examination, wherein he ſeems wholly to clear and excuſe himſelfe from any evil in his flight, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf, affirming in effect, that if he were afraid, it was God that put him into that feare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he alledgeth, that it was only modeſty, and not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any ſin that cauſed him to hide himſelf out of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, In both implying, that if any thing were to be blamed in his flight, and hiding, it muſt be charged not ſo much upon him, as upon God himſelf, who had both terrified him with his voice, and had made him ſuch a creature as was not fit to appear in his ſight. This ſeemes more probable to be <hi>Adams</hi> meaning in this anſwer, (when he alledgeth his nakedneſſe, as an excuſe for his hiding out of the way) then to conceive, that he points at the nakedneſſe of his ſoule, of which it ſeems he had very little feeling hitherto, ſeeing that, in his laſt anſwer, wherein God comes cloſer to him, in charging him home with the very fact, which he laboured to conceal, to excuſe himſelf, he forbears not to charge God with giving him a ſnare to entrap him, in ſtead of a wife to be a meet help for him. We may therefore probably conceive, that he, who in his laſt anſwer, when his ſin, in matter of fact, is ſo fully char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him, ſtands ſo ſtiffely upon his juſtification, was farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at preſent from acknowledging the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what authority had ſhe to give, or <hi>Adam</hi> warrant to receive at her hand, that which was forbidden unto them both? or what manner of excuſe is this, to caſt his wives perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the ballance, againſt Gods expreſſe interdiction? beſides, this anſwer is not to the purpoſe; God asks him whether he had not eaten of the fruit; he anſwers, that he had eaten indeed, but it was by his wives perſwaſion, which God knew as well as he, but enquires not after at preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I did eat]</hi> A cold expreſſion, manifeſting neither any horrour or grief, or ſhame, at ſo foule a fact, and yet ſufficient to juſtifie God, in his proceeding in judgement againſt him, grounded upon this confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own, which he therefore repeats when he gives judgement upon him afterwards, in theſe words, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt hearkened to the voice, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwer of <hi>Adams,</hi> diſcovers in him ſtill a deſire, rather to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſin, then to humble himſelf for it before God, in a free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous acknowledgement, wherein he might have confeſſed in plain termes, that not ſo much his wives ſolicitation, as his own ambitious deſire to become a God, (which his wife no ſooner ſuggeſted, but he embraced) drew him to contemne Gods Commandment, deſpiſe his threatenings, and to forget his mercies, and ſo to eate of the forbidden fruit. So that when we finde <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill unwilling to cloſe with God, to confeſſe his ſin, we have no cauſe to conceive, that he would ſpeak any thing partially on Gods behalfe, from which he is ſo far, that we ſee he forbears not to charge God himſelf (though falſly,) upon the leaſt colour of advantage.

                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, who ſpared not to charge him as far as he could, with the leaſt colour, could faſten no more upon him, but this only, that he gave ſome occaſion to <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, by beſtowing the woman on him, (wherein how far he wrongs God, who intended the woman to be an help to him, the whole <hi>Series</hi> of the Hiſtory of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Creation, &amp; his own acknowledgement of Gods favour, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that help upon him, do evidently diſcover, it muſt neceſſarily be concluded (which is the maine ſcope of this whole Hiſtory,) that ſinne, and all the judgements that followed, proceeded from man himſelfe, and from Satan who ſeduced him; And conſequently that God was</p>

                  <p>Well, let <hi>Adam</hi> do what he can to conceal and excuſe his ſin, yet, when God layes it down to his charge, he muſt be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it before him. Whence</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>AND the Lord ſaid to the woman]</hi> How is it that he leaves the man, before he had drawn him to a more and full acknowledgement of his ſin? He acknowledgeth the fact indeed, but ecxcuſeth it withal, and there remaine many weighty circumſtances, by which the ſinne was much aggravated, which are paſſed over in ſilence, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Adam,</hi> nor enquired after by God himſelf. But we muſt conſider, that God had time and means ſufficient to perform that work upon <hi>Adams</hi> conſcience, afterward in private. At preſent his maine ſcope is to make it appeare, that he had no hand in drawing the man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſinne, by drawing the delinquents both to the confeſſion of the fact, and a diſcovery of the firſt mover thereunto, and the unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the delinquents acknowledgement (who though they ſpeak no more then is drawn from them, yet utter enough to cleare God of having hand in the ſinne) makes much for the credit of their teſtimony on Gods behalf, as we have ſeen already. From <hi>Adam</hi> God turnes next to the woman, that ſhe might likewiſe be convinced of her fact, by her own confeſſion, and thereby both juſtifie the equity of the judgement pronounced againſt her afterwards, and beſides be drawn to appeach the Serpent, as the firſt Solicitor, and enticer to the ſinne, which was the principal thing that God laboured to diſcover for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is this which thou haſt done?]</hi> by tranſgreſſing thy ſelf, &amp; ſeducing thy husband. The queſtion is propounded &amp; demanded with ſome kind of admiration, as if God had ſaid, How? is it poſſible that thou ſhouldſt be ſo deſperately wicked and ſottiſh, as not only to ruine thy ſelf, but to be the deſtruction of thy husband alſo, for whoſe help and comfort thou waſt created? The wiſdom of God, in this examination of the man and woman, is not unworthy our obſervation. The maine thing which God ſought after, was the author and firſt mover to this ſin: But of this, he mentions not a word to the man before, or to the woman now, leſt he might ſeem by his queſtion to direct them what to anſwer. But God who knew the evidence of truth, and the deſire of juſtifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt needs draw from the delinquents as much as he expected, leaves it to flow from themſelves freely without any enquiry at all, that it might the more evidently appear to ſpring meerly from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Serpent beguiled me]</hi> But that on her part, was no fit anſwer to the queſtion propoſed (howſoever it ſerve fully to the end that God aimed at) or at leaſt the main thing that ſhe ſhould have acknowledged, is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or coldly ſatisfied in her anſwer; for God demands not of her, who put that motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into her heart, but how ſhe could be ſo wicked, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo foul a ſin, in ſlighting his Authority, denying his truth, forgetting his mercies, contemning his power, and wronging her husband, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40146:208"/>conſequently deſtroying him for whoſe help and comfort ſhe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. God calls on her to ſet all thoſe things before her eyes, and to conſider what ſhe had done; ſhe on the other ſide paſſing by that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſideration propoſed by God, falls, as her husband had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to excuſe and leſſen the ſin what ſhe can, pretending that it was no voluntary act, proceeding from any evil diſpoſition of her own heart, but ſhe was enveigled by the cunning and policy of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who under faire colours, and pretences beguiled her. Now if God had replied unto her, and demanded what thoſe faire colours and pretences were, which thus drew away her heart, her own anſwer muſt needs have ſtopped her mouth for ever: For ſhe knew that her heart filled with Gods love, ſhould have been wholly carried after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glory. Now the Devil never ſo much as lays before her any ſuch thing, if he had, the womans error had been the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, if her end had been right, and ſhe had only been miſguided in the way that led thereunto, whereas ſhe cloſeth with Satan in taking up a falſe end, and ſeeking her own advancement in ſtead of Gods glory, wherein ſhe was wilfully perverted by the conſent of her own heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I did eat]</hi> Thus then we have a full confeſſion of the fact, by both the delinquents, and by the woman the diſcovery of the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and contriver of all the miſchief, that all the world may juſtifie God in the righteouſneſſe of his judgements, in the puniſhment of the offendors, who by ſeeking new tricks, or inventions (as the wiſe man calls them) to advance them beyond their conditions, were juſtly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their own inventions, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 106.39.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee God will not give over the examination, till he have diſcovered the whole plot of this fowle ſin and every agent in it, firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> then his wife, and at laſt the Devil the deceiver and ſeducer of them both. Whence</p>

                  <p>HItherto the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet before us the examination and confeſſion of the offendors, with their ſeveral excuſes, and the vanity of them. There followes in the next place, their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proportioned indeed unequally, as the offence committed was in divers reſpects unequal, pronounced by God himſelf, with infinite patience and moderation upon them all, in order, as they acted in the ſin, upon the Serpent firſt, next upon the woman, and laſtly upon the man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Lord God ſaid]</hi> After he had examined and convicted the malefactors, he proceeds to ſentence, that he might not only be juſt, but appear to be ſo; which is the reaſon, why he pronounceth the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by word of mouth, that, when thoſe things ſhould be really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, which he here threatens, they might appear to be the act of God, puniſhing ſin in juſtice, by inflicting upon the offendors thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which ſhould come upon them afterwards, according to that which is here pronounced, whereby they are clearly manifeſted to be the acts of God, and being proportioned to the ſin, might appear to be acts of his juſtice, otherwiſe it had been as eaſie for God, to have laid the curſe upon them by effects, without threatening it beforehand. But his deſire is, that they might not only ſmart for their ſin, but might be inſtructed too, and taught by their ſmart, which is one end of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40146:211"/>puniſhments laid upon man, and an eſpecial effect of Gods great mercy, tempered with his juſtice, when the puniſhment it ſelf is thus intended for the good of the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Unto the Serpent]</hi> But why to the Serpent, being an unreaſonable creature, and conſequently unable to underſtand what was ſpoken, and therefore could receive no inſtruction by words?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we muſt conceive, that the ſentence here pronounced, lights not only on the Serpent, but on the devil alſo, who ſet him on work; yea, the latter part of it principally on him, as the cauſe of the ſinne, (as is intimated in thoſe words, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this</hi>) and that it reacheth both the devil and the beaſt. The words then were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Satan, though not by the beaſt, and may be conceived to be directed to him under the Serpents name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the words, though ſpoken to the Serpent, were chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the inſtruction of the man and woman; as our Saviours words directed to the fig-tree, were intended to his diſciples, in whoſe preſence he ſpake to the tree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.19. and indeed the latter part of this cenſure, with which is intermixed the promiſe of the Meſſiah, cannot be otherwiſe taken, but as a comfort intended only to the man and the woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe thou haſt]</hi> Thou Serpent as the Inſtrument, and thou Satan as the principal Agent, who didſt employ him in this action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Done this]</hi> Namely all that hath been mentioned before, belied God, deceived the woman, and by her the man, and drewan them both into rebellion againſt their Creator, and thereby into utter ruine both of themſelves and their poſterity. Thus God is pleaſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his juſtice, in expreſſing the cauſe, before he pronounceth the ſentence. But why doth not God examine the devil, as well as the man and the woman, before he puniſh him?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God had already his end; he was now come to the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſin, which was the chief thing which he ſought after, or at leaſt intended to diſcover.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, it was a vain thing to expect a true confeſſion from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God out of favour endeavours the recovery of the man and woman out of their ſin, by a free confeſſion, and ſight, and ſenſe of their ſin; but he intends no ſuch mercy to Satan, who was already ſentenced to everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou art curſed]</hi> The words imply more then the decree, that the Serpent ſhould be curſed, and import a preſent execution of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the curſe ſhould ſeize upon it at that very inſtant. To curſe ſometimes ſignifies to ſpeak evil of another, or to wiſh evil to him; in this ſenſe we are forbidden to curſe the ruler of the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. that is, to ſpeak evil of him, or to wiſh evil to him. And even in this ſenſe the Serpent is curſed by man, and ſpoken of with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpite, and wiſhed to deſtruction by all men. But curſing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40146:211"/>out of Gods mouth implies more then that, an inflicting of all manner of evil upon any perſon, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.20. the Lord threatens for their rebellion to bring upon this people curſing and vexation, in all that they put their hand unto. So that curſe of our Saviour on the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.21. was the preſent drying up and withering of the tree. This curſe was indeed inflicted on the true Serpent really, as far as it was capable of it, as appears by the particulars following, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be applied to Satan properly, although it be true, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other creatures, is accurſed both by God and man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Above all cattel]</hi> That is, above all tame beaſts, for ſo the word <hi>(Behemah)</hi> in the Original, being oppoſed unto <hi>(Chaiath)</hi> as it is in this place, properly ſignifies, as it doth alſo in other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where it ſtands in like oppoſition, although where there is no ſuch oppoſition, it ſignifies any beaſt indifferently. Evident it is, that no creeping thing is comprehended under that name, whence ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that becauſe the Serpent, both here and in the firſt verſe of this chapter, is compared with foure-footed beaſts, therefore the Serpent, before this curſe, went upon foure feet, as other beaſts do. But this argument is of ſmall force, ſeeing God might, both here and there, compare the Serpent with creatures of any other kinde, to enlarge the compariſon, there, that it was more ſubtile, here that it ſhould be more miſerable then any other beaſt whatſoever, tame or wilde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And above every heaſt of the field]</hi> That is, above every wilde beaſt: thus by a ſufficient diſtribution of beaſts into their kindes, wilde and tame, the Serpent is pronounced, not only more curſed then any of them were in their Creation, but then now they are, even by mans fall the whole creature is made ſubject to vanity. This curſe therefore laid upon the Serpent, is not only a branch of the general curſe, which ſin hath brought upon all the creatures, but a peculiar curſe upon this creature above them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon thy belly ſhalt thou go]</hi> All creeping things go upon the belly, as <hi>Moſes</hi> implies, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.42. where he makes going upon the belly, the difference between creeping things, and thoſe that go upon their feet: the Septuagint here render it, belly and breaſt, to expreſſe the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal <hi>(Gechon)</hi> more fully, which properly ſignifies, the belly of a Serpent, whoſe belly and breaſt ſeem to be all one. But ſeeing going upon the belly is here laid upon the Serpent as a curſe; It gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſpute, whether the Serpent went upon the belly before it was curſed, or nay. A queſtion neither very eaſie, nor neceſſary to determine. Only, it ſeems not probable, that God by the curſe alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhape, or parts of any creatures body, but only the perfect and healthy temper, the ſtrength, regular uſe, and perhaps, (as in man) the comelineſſe of the parts. So that the conjecture of ſome ſeems to be very bold and groundleſſe, that imagine the Serpent to have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with feet at the firſt, which they conceive to be taken away by the curſe. Again, neither is it probable, that the curſe ſhould bring upon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40146:212"/>the Serpent no change at all, although it brought not this change, and therefore that the curſe brought no alteration upon the Serpent, in her going at all: It is moſt probable, that when he curſed the Serpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other creatures, he left ſome diſcernable mark of that curſe upon it above the reſt. But it is replied, that there needed no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all to make it a curſe; ſeeing mans nakedneſſe by ſin became ſhameful, which was not ſo before, without any alteration of the body: and the labour is now a curſe, which before the fall was not ſo. To which it may be eaſily anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that in the ſhame of nakedneſſe there's a change, although not in the parts of the body, (ſave that even mans body it ſelfe, hath not a preſence ſo graceful and full of majeſty, ſince the fall, as he was before) yet in the affections of the minde, in which only ſhame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in mans labour, which now becomes part of his curſe, and was not ſo before, there is an evident and very great change, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. The curſe might cauſe a change in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents going, not by altering the kinde of her going, from ſtepping to creeping, but by appointing it another part of the body to go upon, then that which it went upon before. For the emphaſis ſeemes to be in <hi>Belly,</hi> not in <hi>Go,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth here by the word <hi>Telech,</hi> which is of general ſignification, and extends to any kinde of moving forwards, whether by ſtepping, creeping, ſwimming, or any other kinde of motion. Now if God had given the Serpent a kinde of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, different from that which it had before, it may be probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would have expreſſed it by ſuch a word as might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that difference. This therefore ſeemes to be the moſt likely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that before the curſe the Serpent moved forwards upon the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of her body, with the breaſt, and belly, and head erected, whereas now it creeps on the whole length of the body, which conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may be ſtrengthened by theſe arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we ſee that Serpents at this day, upon occaſion, (as when they aſſault a man or the like) for a time, raiſe up themſelves upon the hinder part of their body, ſo that the former part of it ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, why may we not conceive then, that before their ſtrength was weakened by this curſe, they might do that alwayes which now they can do for a ſhift.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we allow the Serpent ſuch a manner of creeping, with the former part of the body erect, we may more plainly ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Satan made choice of the Serpent in tempting the man, for the ſubtilty of it, which might conſiſt ſomewhat in altering and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her going. When ſhe was to conveigh her ſelf into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den uneſpied, ſhe could apply her body cloſe to the ground; when ſhe was to ſpeak to the woman, ſhe could raiſe her ſelf upright, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with her, as it were, mouth to mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may in this curſe diſcover the equity of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Serpent. For if the Serpent could apply her ſelf to do
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40146:212"/>miſchief uneſpied, good reaſon ſhe ſhould be accurſed to go in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ever after, ſo that this curſe might point directly at the ſinne, for which it was inflicted. Now theſe at the beſt are but conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And duſt ſhalt thou eate]</hi> But experience teacheth, that Serpents feed alſo upon, and devoure other ſmall vermine; which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſeemes alſo to imply, when ſpeaking of that peace that ſhould be in the reſtauration of the Church, between all creatures, he names the Serpent amongſt the reſt, affirming that it ſhould live by duſt, as the lion ſhould do by ſtraw, implying, that they both live by prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon other creatures at preſent, which then they ſhould forbear. Some therefore by eating duſt conceive, that God meanes living hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Serpents do, which, in the winter ſeaſon, living moſt in their holes, get little food to ſuſtain themſelves. But that is the condition of other beaſts as well as of Serpents: it ſeems therefore, that this feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the duſt, is oppoſed to the former manner of the Serpents feeding upon herbes and fruits, after the manner of other beaſts; for, if before the curſe ſhe went with the former part of her body erect, as we have ſhewed already, then might ſhe be eaſily able to reach many ſorts of herbes and fruits, though growing above the ground, as other beaſts do, whereas now creeping with her very mouth upon the earth, ſhe muſt neceſſarily take her food out of the duſt, and ſo lick in ſome duſt withal: ſo that though the duſt be not all her food, yet ſhe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all her food out of the duſt, and licking in the duſt with it, may not improperly be ſaid to eate duſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the dayes]</hi> Both thou, and all thy kinde hereafter, to the worlds end. But what had the Serpent deſerved, being an unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently uncapable of any purpoſe or intention to do evil? why is the beaſt puniſhed for Satans fault, who made uſe of the Serpent only as his inſtrument, to do miſchief? To that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered, that the dereſtation and hatefulneſſe of ſin is ſo great, that it is fit to be manifeſted upon whatſoever is defiled with it. Thus we break in pieces the ſword, dagge, or other inſtrument of a Princes death, dam up a Well in which any man hath been drowned. And God himſelf will require a mans life at the hands of every beaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5. and therefore in his own Law, appoints an Oxe that goares any man to death, to be ſtoned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.28.</p>
                  <p>This part of the curſe (if we take the words according to the letter) we ſee moſt properly belongs to the beaſt, whereof Satan made uſe, for the acting of this miſchief. Some there are notwithſtanding, that conceive, that under the curſe upon the Serpent, is ſhadowed out the curſe laid by God upon Satan, who being created to look upwards, for his Apoſtaſie, was by Gods juſt judgement throwen down to the earth, and abaſed even below the duſt, and inſtead of delighting himſelfe in God, was carried by the inordinate motion of his ſpirit, to exerciſe himſelf, and to take delight in baſe and ſenſual things, more vile then duſt it ſelfe, which was appointed to be the Serpents food. But this
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40146:213"/>curſe upon Satan cannot be conceived to be inflicted in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was laid upon him by God, before he was an actor in this ſinne, Only in this, that God will not vouchſafe to reaſon the caſe with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, before he layes his judgement upon him.</p>

Again (for the next clauſe) it is true, that Serpents uſually bite the heele, and that men may, and do ſometimes, tread on their heads.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40146:216"/>But it is moſt evident, that God in denouncing this curſe, aimes not at the hurt which men and Serpents either do unto, or receive one from the other. Becauſe this combate is not ſaid to fall out between the Serpent and all men in general, but between him, and the womans ſeed, by which (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) is meant both Chriſt, and the holy ſeed, ſuch as are members of him. So that in this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord repreſenting eſpecially the combate between Chriſt and Satan, thinks fit to borrow a metaphor from the fight between men and Serpents; Shadowing out Satan under the name of the Serpent, and the combate between Chriſt and him, under the fimilitude of the Serpents fight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I will put enmity]</hi> That is, deadly and irreconcileable hatred: which God is ſaid to put between them, partly by decreeing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the hatred of Satan, and his inſtruments againſt the godly; and partly by infuſing into the hearts of the holy ſeed, a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and hatred of Satan, and all his followers. Thus becauſe familiarity between Satan and the woman, had given him advantage to ſeduce and deceive her to her own deſtruction; God to prevent that miſchief for time to come, ſo ſtirs up the ſpirit both of her and her ſeed againſt him hereafter, that ſhe ſhould hate him as unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he hated her, ſo that ſhe ſhould henceforth avoid him, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no more unto his counſel. This work God takes into his own hand, as is implied in thoſe words <hi>(I will put, &amp;c.)</hi> that from thenceforth mans eſtate might ſtand firme, when it ſhould not be in his power to do what he would, as it was before, ſeeing when he had power in his own hand, either to ſtand or fall, he was quickly, and eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. But God ſhould reſerve the power in his own hand to ſettle him in ſuch a condition, that man ſhould not be able to alter if he would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Between thee and the woman]</hi> We have here three paires of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, matched in oppoſition one againſt the other.</p>

Now the putting of this enmity between man and Satan, is both a part of Gods curſe upon him, and withal not the leaſt, but the greateſt portion of the bleſſing, promiſed to man. Of Satans curſe that he ſhould be alwayes kicking againſt the pricks, hating and perſecuting the womans ſeed, without cauſe, to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction at the laſt. And of mans bleſſing, whoſe ſafety and duty, is to hate Satan with a perfect hatred; whereby, though he be not wholly freed from, yet he is the leſſe endangered by his ſnares, eſpecially ſeeing he reſiſts, in a ſort, by Gods power, and not by his own; for ſo much ſeemes to be implied in that phraſe <hi>(I will put enmity.)</hi> As if
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40146:216"/>God had ſaid, It ſhall be no longer in mans choice to accord with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or to hate him; but I will ſo guide and over-rule his heart, by my ſpirit, that he ſhall perſiſt conſtantly in this hatred, and warre againſt him, till that enemy be troden under his feet. Thus God ſeeing how ſoon man had waſted that ſtock of grace, that he had put into his hand, reſolves to provide better for him in time to come, and to keep his heart and will in his own hand, guiding it by his own Spirit that he might not hazard his eſtate any more, nor be cheated of it by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan any more, as he had been. So that in mans reſtitution, after his fall, his ſtate was indeed impaired in reſpect of the perfection of it, in this preſent life; for he muſt be bruiſed in the heele, by divers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and ſlips into ſin thereby, but is much bettered in reſpect of the firmneſſe of it, as God implies in that promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. It may be demanded, why the woman only is mentioned in taking up this enmity againſt Satan, whereas the promiſe belongs as well, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to the man. But it ſeemes to be done upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the promiſe might be the firmer: for if Satan could not prevaile againſt the woman, being the weaker veſſel, it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that he ſhould prevaile againſt the man, which was the ſtronger. It may be withal that God mentions the woman, becauſe ſhe was the firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and beſides the ſeducer of her own husband; Now if God would pardon the woman, much more might the man aſſure himſelf of the recovery of his favour, whoſe ſin admitted the more excuſe, becauſe he was drawn in by the example, and allurement of his wife.</p>
                  <p>Another ground upon which God mentions the woman, and not the man, may be upon two other reſpects, either becauſe ſhe moſt needed comfort, that had moſt cauſe to be humbled; Or rather becauſe the ſeed mentioned afterwards, which was to continue the war, and at laſt to obtaine the conqueſt over Satan, muſt ſpecially be meant of Chriſt, who was made of a woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of man: wherefore becauſe he was more properly the ſeed of the woman then of the man, it was more fit to call him her ſeed, then the ſeed of the man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And between thy ſeed]</hi> Seed ſignifies properly that in any creature, by which the kinde thereof is propagated: here, and in many other places of Scripture, it ſignifies perſons begotten and propagated of that ſeed. So that the womans ſeed are her children, the men and women that were to come, and be begotten of her body. Now though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to ſpeak properly, can have no ſuch ſeed, that is, can have none that come of him, by natural generation, of which ſpirits are altogether uncapable; yet becauſe the reſt of the devils are of the ſame nature with their Prince, and all wicked men, that are corrupted by him, are of the ſame diſpoſition, beare his image, and reſemble him, as children uſually do their parents; therefore all wicked men, and the reſt of the devils are called his ſeed: by this name wicked men are called, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40146:217"/>3.10. ſeeing they are of him (as our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>John</hi> 8.44.) not by natural, but by ſpiritual generation, that is, by receiving ſuch falſe principles as Satan infuſeth into their hearts, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like him in affection, and diſpoſition, and ſerve him as a child doth a parent, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And her ſeed]</hi> Not all that are ſo by natural generation, but ſuch as are her ſeed, according to the ſpirit, as well as according to the fleſh. And they onely are called her ſeed, becauſe the reſt degenerating, are no better then baſtards, and the ſeed of Satan. By this ſeed of the woman then, we are to underſtand the whole body of the Church, whereof Chriſt is the head, who is principally intended in this name, as appeares by the next clauſe, when it is ſaid <hi>(It ſhall bruiſe.)</hi> in the ſingular number, meaning principally Chriſt (whoſe work it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubdue Satan) and together with him, and by his power, all ſuch as being renued after his image, are by the ſpirit ingraffed into his body. That Chriſt ſhould be called the womans ſeed, we need not wonder, ſeeing he took the ſubſtance of his fleſh of her body, and was made immediately only of a woman, and not of a man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head]</hi> That is, that ſeed of the woman: he meanes Chriſt principally, who alſo ſhall do it by his own power, although it be true that by the power of Chriſt the godly overcome the wicked one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. But to ſpeak truly, the whole body of the Church whereof Chriſt is head, may be ſaid to do that which is done by Chriſt, if we look on the Church, as united into one body with Chriſt; as the acts of any member of the body, are aſcribed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as that which is done by the hand of any man is ſaid to be done by the men. As for the word <hi>(Shuph)</hi> here uſed in the original, which we render, <hi>Bruiſe,</hi> we finde it beſides this place no where in Scripture, ſave only <hi>Job</hi> 9.17. here we have it twice, but in the firſt place it imports only wounding, ſeeing it lights only on the heele which is far from any vital part; in the later clauſe it implies cruſhing to pieces as lighting upon the head, which is the fountaine of life, by the cruſhing whereof muſt needs follow the total and final deſtroying of Satan, and all his might.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele]</hi> The heele we know is the loweſt, and baſeſt part of the body, the wounds whereof endanger not the life at all. By Chriſts heele then may be meant both the humane nature of Chriſt, which is the lower and baſer part of his perſon, in which Satan bruiſed him, when after many outward troubles, in the dayes of his fleſh, he brought him by his wicked inſtruments, at length, to the death of the croſſe: And withal we may take in all the faithful, which are members of Chriſt, who are divers wayes bruiſed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Chriſt in them (who in their afflictions are ſaid to fill up the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.) ſometimes by perſecutions, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, ſometimes by inward temptations, whereby though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan canſt not prevaile againſt that life of grace, by which they live ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, (ſeeing that life is hid with Chriſt in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40146:217"/>he divers wayes wounds and afflicts their foules, by alluring and prevailing, to draw them by his wiles into divers ſins, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in them afterwards much unquietneſſe and affliction of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>That in this curſe pronounced by God againſt Satan, is involved the gracious Promiſe of the reſtitution, not only of our firſt Parents, whom the devil had thus beguiled, but of their holy ſeed alſo, is evident, and is ſo farre acknowledged, that thoſe words are taken to be the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme of the Patriarchs, containing the principal grounds of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were afterwards more fully opened by the Prophets. This Promiſe, in the firſt clauſe of it ſeemes to be directed to our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents eſpecially, in which God aſſures them, and threatens Satan, that this folle of theirs ſhould prove no thorough conqueſt. But though Satan ſeemed to have prevailed with them, to take part with him againſt God, yet God would ſo far open their eyes, and prevaile upon their hearts, that they ſhould caſt off his yoke, hate him, and fight againſt him, and by the Power of Chriſt their Head ſubdue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer him at the laſt. The Promiſe of the recovery of mankinde out of Satans bondage, and from under Gods curſe; containes in it theſe principal heads, all of them expreſſed or implied in thoſe few words, being ſo many grounds of our faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods Promiſe of grace is every way free, not ſolicited by <hi>Adam,</hi> and much leſſe deſerved, as being made unto him now, when he had offended God in the higheſt degree, and ſtood in enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and therefore muſt needs proceed from Gods free Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is certain and infallible, as depending, not upon mans will, but upon Gods, who ſpeaks not doubtfully or conditionally, but poſitively and peremptorily, that he will do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it ſhall be conſtant and unchangeable the inward hatred and outward warres between Satan and the holy ſeed, ſhall not ceaſe, till they end at laſt in Satans total and final ruine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That it ſhall not extend to all the ſeed of the woman, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, but to ſome that are choſen out of her ſeed. For ſome of them ſhall joyne with Satan againſt their owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The effect of this gracious promiſe, ſhall be the ſanctifying of their hearts, whom God will ſave, manifeſted in the hatred of Satan, and all his wayes; which though they had formerly embraced, yet now they ſhould abhor.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This work of Sanctification ſhall not be wrought upon them, as a Statuary faſhions a ſtone into an image; but God ſhall make uſe of their wills and affections, to ſtirre them up, and to ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, as this word <hi>(Enmity)</hi> neceſſarily implies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe affections ſhall not be ſmothered and concealed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of the heart, but ſhall outwardly manifeſt themſelves in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40146:218"/>ſerious endeavours, for the oppoſing of Satan and his power, as the war here mentioned, and intimated by the wounds on both ſides, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſeth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The work of Sanctification, though it ſhall be infallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, yet ſhall be imperfect, as is implied in the bruiſes, which the godly ſhall receive by Satans hand, not only by outward afflictions, but by inward temptations, which ſhall wound their ſoules, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into divers ſins, all implied in that phraſe of bruiſing the heele.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thoſe wounds which they receive at Satans hands ſhall not be deadly, nor quench the life of grace, which the devil ſhall not be able to deſtroy, as is intimated in that part of the body which ſhall be wounded, which is the heele, farre enough from any vital part.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Author of this work of ſanctification ſhall not be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but God by his Spirit. For it is he that ſhall put enmity into their hearts, againſt Satan and his ſeede, as the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. This work of Sanctification by the Spirit, ſhall be eſtabliſhed by their union with Chriſt their Head, with whom they ſhall be joyned into one body, as is implied, when Chriſt and his members are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. By vertue of this union the holy ſeed ſhall have an intereſt in, and a title to all that Chriſt works. For ſo, in effect, Chriſts victory over Satan is called their victory, when it is ſaid, the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head, that is, Chriſt and his members ſhall do it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For the making way to this union and communion between Chriſt and his members, he ſhall take on him the very nature of man, ſo that he ſhall truly and properly be called the ſeede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Notwithſtanding, he ſhall not be her ſeed by the ordinary way of natural generation, but he ſhall be made immediately only of a woman, not by the help of man, for which cauſe he is called here the ſeed of the woman, and not of the man.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In this fleſh of his, Chriſt ſhall fight with Satan, who after divers combates, ſhall prevaile ſo far upon this ſonne of the woman, as to bring him by his inſtruments to the death of the Croſſe, which is the bruiſing of the heele here mentioned, as farre as concernes Chriſts own perſon.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. This ſuffering of Chriſt in his fleſh ſhall not wound him to death; for it ſhall be only a bruiſe in the heele, which is farre from any vital part.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. This combate between the two Commanders, Chriſt and Satan, and their armies, in the iſſue and concluſion thereof, ſhall end in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and final overthrowing of Satan, and breaking in pieces of all his power, termed in this place the cruſhing of his head.</p>
                  <p>This ample Promiſe, concerning the reſtoring of our firſt Parents,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40146:218"/>and withall of all their poſterity after them, we ſee is pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, as a part of his curſe, God telling him that this ſhould be his judgement, that thoſe perſons, whom he had beguiled by faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and drawn into rebellion againſt God, ſhould be delivered out of his ſnares.

The ſame ſlander was taken up and faſtened upon the Churches in the Primitive times, as all Hiſtories record: the leſs cauſe have we to mervaile, that it ſhould be charged upon us in our dayes; how unjuſtly it will appeare,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we examine the principles of religion, and the rules which the Doctrine thereof preſcribes, all of them tending to love, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, patience in wrongs, readineſſe to forgive, nay to render good for evil.</p>

But that we ſhall alwayes finde to be raiſed, not by thoſe that embrace it, but by ſuch as oppoſe it: as there is trouble in robbing an houſe, but it is cauſed by thieves that break in and ſteale, not by the true man, that maintaines the poſſeſſion of his own goods.

                     <p>When ſin began, then enmity began, but from whom did it firſt ſpring?

                     <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children]</hi> That is, with bitter and ſharp paines, which moſt women generally ſuffer in their travail, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to the endangering, yea, as we ſee ſometimes, to the loſſe of their lives: this is a farther encreaſe of the judgement; to ſickneſſe in conceiving, are added ſtrong paines in travaile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thy deſire ſhall be to thy husband]</hi> The ſame phraſe the Lord u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to expreſſe <hi>Abels</hi> ſubjection to his brother <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.7. which implies not only ſubjection to him, in obeying his commands, but reacheth farther, to the bringing under unto him, the very deſires of her heart, to be regulated by him, ſo farre that it ſhould not be lawful for her to will, or deſire what ſhe her ſelfe liked, but only what her husband ſhould approve and allow. A juſt law unto her, who having given way to her own inordinate phantaſie, and appetite, ſtirred up in her by the ſuggeſtions of Satan, had undone at once both her ſelf and husband. And yet a rule given her for her own good and ſafety, who having by experience found how ill ſhe was able to moderate her own deſires, muſt needs be the more ſecured, by having a Moderator ſet over her, by whoſe wiſdome, ſuch inordinate motions of her minde, might at leaſt be ſo farre kept in order, that they ſhould not break out into outward Acts. Now it muſt needs be, that the man being of the two, of the more noble ſex, and the woman being created both for him, and out of him, he muſt from the beginning have preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the woman; but that may ſeem to be at the firſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a priority in order, then a ſuperiority in authority. And both of them being endued with perfect underſtanding, and with wills and affections rightly ordered every way, their government (if they had continued in that condition) might, in all probability, have been carried on rather by conſent, then by preſcription, when they ſhould both of them deſire and approve the ſame things, in which caſe injunctions had been needleſſe.</p>
                  <p>In examining this ſentence, which God paſſeth upon the woman firſt, and upon the man afterwards, it is worthy our obſervation, that in them both we finde a mixture of mercy, tempered with judgement. The woman ſhall endure paines, and ſorrow in conceiving, and in bringing forth children, but that neceſſarily ſuppoſeth, that ſhe ſhall have children, and a poſterity, and leave an iſſue behinde her, whereas in the extremity of Juſtice, ſhe might, at that very preſent, have been cut off from the earth, according to the curſe threatened; <hi>In the day when thou cateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> And as for the man, his labour (which at firſt was unto him a recreation and delight) ſhall now be hard and painful; but withal there's a promiſe enterlaced, that the ſweat of his face ſhall yield him bread, that is, meanes for the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40146:232"/>ſuſtaining of his life. And that we may more clearly diſcover the way of God herein, we muſt in a ſpecial manner obſerve, that this ſentence is pronounced againſt them both, after the promiſe of Chriſt made unto them in the verſe praecedent; in whom God offered to our firſt Parents peace and reconciliation, although he lay upon them theſe quick remembrances, both of their own ſin, and of Gods juſt diſpleaſure againſt them for it.

It is true, that love is a ſtrong band to tie men to obedience, and might be ſufficient if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but ſeeing we know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. and conſequently, can believe but in part, it muſt needs follow, that there muſt be the ſame defect in our love that we finde in our faith and knowledge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that is grounded, and conſequently there needs ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help by the terrour of judgement, to keep down the motions of the fleſh, that the weakneſſe of our love may not be hindred, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us on with life and conſtancy, to the acting of thoſe duties of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that God requires at our hands.</p>
                     <p>It is further to be obſerved, that the Lord thinks it fit to repreſent the terrour of his wrath by ſome viſible object: for if it might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the Cherubims that were placed at the entrance of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe were diſcernable by the eye; it muſt needs be granted, that the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword which they held was viſible.
